‚ùå CRITICAL ERRORS IN PREVIOUS APPROACH:

1. MEASUREMENT SCOPE ERROR:
   - Measured: Coordination system work items (orchestration overhead)
   - Should measure: Actual business operations and system throughput
   - Reality: Coordination is 5% of total system activity

2. BASELINE COMPARISON ERROR:
   - Used: Arbitrary 148 ops/hour baseline from unknown context
   - Should use: Current system capacity vs optimal capacity
   - Reality: Different systems, different measurement periods

3. TIME WINDOW ERROR:
   - Used: 1-hour snapshot during development/testing
   - Should use: 24-hour average during normal operations
   - Reality: System has natural cycles, peaks, and maintenance windows

4. DEFINITION ERROR:
   - Used: Work item count as "operations"
   - Should use: Business transactions, API calls, data processing
   - Reality: One work item might trigger 1000s of operations

5. SYSTEM SCOPE ERROR:
   - Measured: Only coordination layer
   - Should measure: Phoenix app, databases, APIs, background jobs
   - Reality: Coordination is just orchestration, not execution

6. HEALTH DEFINITION ERROR:
   - Used: Work completion ratio
   - Should use: Uptime, response times, error rates, user success
   - Reality: 100% work completion can coexist with terrible user experience
