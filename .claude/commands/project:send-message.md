# Enterprise Inter-Agent Communication with ART Coordination

**Purpose**: Nanosecond-precision messaging system with Scrum at Scale team coordination and YAML-first storage.

```bash
/project:send-message [recipient_team] [recipient_role] [priority] [subject] [content]
```

## Enterprise Communication Framework

### Nanosecond Message Tracking
```bash
# Generate unique message ID with nanosecond precision
MESSAGE_ID="msg_$(date +%s%N)"
SENDER_AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"
TIMESTAMP="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

# Register message in YAML coordination system
register_message() {
    yq eval '.messages["'$MESSAGE_ID'"] = {
        "message_id": "'$MESSAGE_ID'",
        "from": {
            "agent_id": "'$SENDER_AGENT_ID'",
            "team": "'$sender_team'",
            "role": "'$sender_role'"
        },
        "to": {
            "team": "'$recipient_team'",
            "role": "'$recipient_role'"
        },
        "priority": "'$priority'",
        "subject": "'$subject'",
        "content": "'$content'",
        "timestamp": "'$TIMESTAMP'",
        "status": "sent",
        "scrum_context": {
            "sprint": "'$CURRENT_SPRINT'",
            "pi": "'$CURRENT_PI'",
            "coordination_type": "'$coordination_type'"
        }
    }' -i .agent_coordination/messages.yaml
}
```

## Scrum at Scale Communication Types

### 1. Cross-Team Coordination Messages
```yaml
cross_team_communication:
  dependency_coordination:
    priority: "high"
    response_time: "< 2 hours"
    escalation: "scrum_of_scrums"
    
  integration_planning:
    priority: "medium"
    response_time: "< 4 hours"
    escalation: "system_architect"

## Enhanced Message Types with ART Context

### 1. Sprint Goal Coordination Messages
```bash
send_sprint_goal_message() {
    recipient_team="$1"
    urgency="$2"
    sprint_context="$3"
    
    # Determine priority based on sprint goal impact
    if sprint_goal_at_risk; then
        priority="critical"
        response_time="immediate"
    elif story_blocked; then
        priority="high" 
        response_time="2_hours"
    else
        priority="medium"
        response_time="1_day"
    fi
    
    # Add sprint context to message
    message_content="Sprint Goal Context: $sprint_context
    
    Current Sprint: $CURRENT_SPRINT
    Sprint Goal: $(get_current_sprint_goal)
    Team Velocity Impact: $(calculate_velocity_impact)

    $content"
    
    register_message
}
```

### 2. Cross-Team Dependency Messages
```bash
send_dependency_coordination() {
    blocking_team="$1"
    blocked_team="$2"
    dependency_type="$3"
    
    # Calculate impact on sprint commitments
    impact_assessment=$(assess_dependency_impact "$blocking_team" "$blocked_team")
    
    # Auto-escalate critical dependencies
    if [ "$impact_assessment" == "critical_sprint_risk" ]; then
        escalate_to_scrum_of_scrums "$dependency_type"
        notify_release_train_engineer
    fi
    
    # Create structured dependency message
    dependency_message="Cross-Team Dependency Alert
    
    Blocking Team: $blocking_team
    Blocked Team: $blocked_team
    Dependency Type: $dependency_type
    Sprint Impact: $impact_assessment
    
    Required Action: $(generate_dependency_resolution_plan)
    Timeline: $(calculate_resolution_timeline)
    Escalation Path: $(determine_escalation_path)"
    
    register_message
}
```

### 3. Quality Gate Communication
```bash
send_quality_gate_notification() {
    affected_teams="$1"
    quality_issue="$2"
    remediation_plan="$3"
    
    # Assess impact on Definition of Done
    dod_compliance=$(assess_dod_compliance_impact)
    velocity_impact=$(calculate_quality_velocity_impact)
    
    # Broadcast to all affected teams
    for team in $affected_teams; do
        quality_message="Quality Gate Alert
        
        Issue: $quality_issue
        DoD Compliance Risk: $dod_compliance
        Team Velocity Impact: $velocity_impact
        
        Immediate Actions Required:

        Quality Standards: $(reference_art_quality_standards)
        Support Available: $(list_quality_support_resources)"
        
        register_message_for_team "$team"
    done
}
```

### 4. PI Objective Risk Communication
```bash
send_pi_objective_alert() {
    at_risk_objective="$1"
    risk_level="$2"
    mitigation_options="$3"
    
    # Calculate business value impact
    business_value_at_risk=$(calculate_business_value_impact "$at_risk_objective")
    affected_teams=$(identify_teams_for_objective "$at_risk_objective")
    
    # Create high-priority ART-wide alert
    pi_alert_message="ðŸš¨ PI OBJECTIVE AT RISK ðŸš¨
    
    Objective: $at_risk_objective
    Risk Level: $risk_level
    Business Value at Risk: $business_value_at_risk
    
    Affected Teams: $affected_teams
    Current PI Progress: $(get_current_pi_progress)
    Time Remaining: $(calculate_time_to_pi_end)
    
    Mitigation Options:
    $mitigation_options
    
    Immediate Coordination Required:
    - Emergency Scrum of Scrums
    - Resource reallocation assessment
    - Scope adjustment consideration"
    
    # Broadcast to all teams and RTE
    broadcast_to_art "$pi_alert_message"
}
```

## Advanced Communication Features

### 1. AI-Powered Message Routing
```bash
intelligent_message_routing() {
    message_content="$1"
    
    # Analyze message content and determine optimal recipients
    content_analysis=$(ai_analyze_message_content "$message_content")
    optimal_recipients=$(determine_optimal_recipients "$content_analysis")
    urgency_level=$(assess_message_urgency "$content_analysis")
    
    # Route based on Scrum at Scale context
    for recipient in $optimal_recipients; do
        route_message_to_recipient "$recipient" "$urgency_level"
    done
}
```

### 2. Automated Response Suggestions
```bash
generate_response_suggestions() {
    received_message_id="$1"
    
    # Analyze incoming message and suggest responses
    message_context=$(extract_message_context "$received_message_id")
    suggested_actions=$(ai_generate_response_suggestions "$message_context")
    
    # Provide context-aware response templates
    echo "Suggested Responses:"
    echo "$suggested_actions"
    
    # Auto-generate draft responses for common scenarios
    if standard_handoff_message; then
        generate_handoff_acknowledgment_draft
    elif impediment_escalation; then
        generate_impediment_response_draft
    fi
}
```

### 3. Communication Pattern Analysis
```bash
analyze_communication_patterns() {
    # Identify communication bottlenecks and patterns
    frequent_senders=$(analyze_message_frequency)
    response_time_patterns=$(analyze_response_times)
    escalation_triggers=$(identify_escalation_patterns)
    
    # Generate improvement recommendations
    communication_improvements=$(suggest_communication_optimizations)
    
    echo "Communication Health Analysis:"
    echo "Frequent Senders: $frequent_senders"
    echo "Average Response Time: $response_time_patterns"
    echo "Escalation Patterns: $escalation_triggers"
    echo "Improvement Suggestions: $communication_improvements"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Sprint Coordination
```bash
/project:send-message development_team Developer_Agent high "Story Blocker" "Authentication API dependency blocking user management story"
/project:send-message platform_team DevOps_Agent critical "Deploy Pipeline Failure" "CI/CD pipeline failing, blocking sprint demo"
/project:send-message coordination_team Scrum_Master_Agent medium "Velocity Concern" "Team velocity declining, need impediment analysis"
```

### Cross-Team Dependencies
```bash
/project:send-message platform_team Architect_Agent high "Integration Requirements" "Need API contract for user management integration"
/project:send-message all_teams broadcast critical "PI Objective Risk" "Customer authentication objective at risk, immediate coordination needed"
```

### Quality and Compliance
```bash
/project:send-message development_team QA_Agent medium "Test Coverage Alert" "Coverage below ART standard (85%), need additional tests"
/project:send-message all_teams broadcast high "Security Compliance" "New security requirements affecting all team deliverables"
```

## Enterprise Integration Benefits
