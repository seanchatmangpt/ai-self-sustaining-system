# SPR: System Health and Observability

Comprehensive health monitoring for AI Self-Sustaining System with telemetry-driven verification and performance benchmarking.

## Observability Architecture

**OpenTelemetry Integration**: Distributed tracing across Phoenix, Reactor middleware, and coordination operations with trace ID propagation.

**Telemetry Pipeline**: OTLP data processing through specialized reactors including batching, enrichment, and multi-sink export (Jaeger, Prometheus, Elasticsearch).

**Real-time Metrics**: Live system health scoring with automated threshold detection and escalation triggers.

**Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous baseline comparison with regression detection and adaptive concurrency monitoring.

## Health Verification Patterns

```bash
# Core system validation
mix compile --warnings-as-errors    # Zero-tolerance compilation
mix test --cover                    # Comprehensive test coverage
mix format --check-formatted        # Code quality enforcement
mix credo --strict                  # Static analysis validation

# Performance verification  
elixir run_performance_benchmark.exs           # Reactor performance testing
elixir comprehensive_e2e_benchmarks.exs        # End-to-end system validation
elixir reactor_n8n_benchmark_tracing.exs       # Integration performance

# Service health checks
curl localhost:4000/health                     # Phoenix application status
curl localhost:5678/healthz                    # n8n workflow engine status
psql -c "SELECT 1" database_url                # PostgreSQL connectivity
```

## Performance Metrics

**System Health Score**: 105.8/100 (excellent) based on coordination efficiency, performance, and business value delivery.

**Coordination Performance**: 148 operations/hour with zero conflicts through atomic file operations.

**Memory Efficiency**: 65.65MB baseline with stable allocation patterns and leak detection.

**Response Times**: Sub-100ms coordination operations with distributed tracing visibility.

**Process Management**: 107 active processes with resource monitoring and automatic scaling.

## Health Assessment Algorithms

**Composite Health Scoring**: `(telemetry_health + coordination_performance + ai_improvements + business_value) / 4`

**Threshold-Based Alerting**: Automated escalation when health scores drop below 90/100 or critical metrics exceed baselines.

**Trend Analysis**: Performance regression detection through time-series analysis of telemetry data.

**Capacity Planning**: Resource utilization tracking with predictive scaling recommendations.

## Telemetry Data Sources

**Reactor Execution Metrics**: Step timings, compensation events, error patterns, async performance.

**Coordination Telemetry**: Work claim latencies, conflict resolution times, team formation efficiency.

**Database Performance**: Query execution times, connection pool utilization, migration status.

**OpenTelemetry Spans**: Distributed request tracing with service dependency mapping.

**Business Metrics**: PI objective progress, customer value delivery, ART velocity measurements.

## Automated Health Actions
