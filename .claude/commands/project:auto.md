# Enterprise Autonomous AI Agent Swarm Operation

**Purpose**: Fully autonomous AI agent swarm with self-coordination, nanosecond precision IDs, and enterprise Scrum at Scale integration.

```bash
/project:auto
```

**No Arguments Required**: The AI agent swarm autonomously determines optimal focus areas, team formation, and work prioritization through intelligent analysis and Scrum at Scale coordination.

## Enterprise Autonomous Agent Framework

### Nanosecond Agent Identification System
Every autonomous cycle automatically generates mathematically unique agent IDs:
```bash
AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"  # Example: agent_1749970490597398000
export AGENT_ID

# Determine current PI and Sprint context
CURRENT_PI="PI_$(date +%Y)_Q$(($(date +%-m-1)/3+1))"
CURRENT_SPRINT="sprint_$(date +%Y)_$(date +%U)"
export CURRENT_PI CURRENT_SPRINT
```

**Benefits of Nanosecond IDs**:
- ✅ **Mathematical Uniqueness**: Impossible collisions across distributed systems
- ✅ **High Precision Tracking**: Sub-second operation timing and coordination
- ✅ **Sortable Timestamps**: Natural chronological ordering of agent activities
- ✅ **Collision-Free Scaling**: Supports unlimited concurrent agent instantiation

## Scrum at Scale Autonomous Sequence

### 1. Agent Initialization with Team Assignment
```bash
# Enhanced autonomous startup with Scrum at Scale integration
autonomous_startup() {
    # Generate nanosecond agent ID
    AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"
    
    # Initialize with enterprise coordination
    /project:init-agent $team_preference
    
    # Register in ART coordination system
    register_agent_in_scrum_team "$AGENT_ID" "$assigned_team" 100 "autonomous_development"
    
    # Assess current PI and sprint context
    analyze_pi_and_sprint_context
}
```

### 2. Sprint Work Discovery and Claiming
```bash
# Intelligent work claiming from sprint backlog
discover_and_claim_work() {
    # Analyze current sprint commitments and team velocity
    current_sprint_status=$(yq eval '.current_sprint' .agent_coordination/backlog.yaml)
    team_capacity=$(get_team_available_capacity "$AGENT_TEAM")
    
    # Prioritize work based on sprint goals and PI objectives
    if [ "$critical_pi_objective_at_risk" == "true" ]; then
        /project:claim-work emergency
    elif [ "$sprint_goal_work_available" == "true" ]; then
        /project:claim-work sprint_goal
    elif [ "$team_capacity" -gt 20 ]; then
        /project:claim-work high_priority
    else
        /project:claim-work coordination
    fi
}
```

### 3. Enterprise Work Execution with Velocity Tracking
```bash
# Execute claimed work with continuous progress tracking
execute_sprint_work() {
    while [ "$work_status" != "completed" ]; do
        # Execute work increment with quality gates
        implement_work_increment_with_tdd
        
        # Update team velocity and sprint burndown
        update_progress_and_velocity "$WORK_ITEM_ID" "$completion_percentage"
        
        # Participate in Scrum events if scheduled
        participate_in_scrum_events
        
        # Enforce ART-level Definition of Done
        enforce_definition_of_done_compliance
        
        # 15-minute progress updates for team visibility
        sleep 900
    done
    
    # Complete work with story point contribution
    complete_work_with_velocity_update "$story_points"
}
```

### 4. Scrum at Scale Event Participation
```bash
# Automated participation in enterprise Scrum events
participate_in_scrum_events() {
    current_time=$(date +%H%M)
    
    # Daily Scrum of Scrums (09:30 UTC)
    if [ "$current_time" == "0930" ]; then
        participate_in_scrum_of_scrums
    fi
    
    # Sprint Planning (bi-weekly)
    if sprint_planning_scheduled; then
        contribute_to_sprint_planning
    fi
    
    # System Demo (bi-weekly)
    if system_demo_scheduled; then
        prepare_and_present_increment
    fi
    
    # PI Planning (quarterly)
    if pi_planning_scheduled; then
        participate_in_pi_planning
    fi
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Autonomous Swarm Operation - Intelligence-Driven

```bash
/project:auto  # Single command - agents autonomously:
```

**The AI swarm will automatically:**
1. **Analyze System State**: Assess current health, priorities, and capabilities
2. **Form Optimal Teams**: Create specialized teams (coordination, development, platform, innovation)
3. **Determine Focus Areas**: Select highest-impact work based on:
   - Critical PI objectives at risk
   - Sprint goal progress and threats
   - Cross-team dependency blockers
   - Team velocity trends and impediments
   - Quality gate failures and technical debt
   - Customer value delivery opportunities (JTBD)
4. **Coordinate Work Distribution**: Use Scrum at Scale methodology for enterprise coordination
5. **Execute with Telemetry**: Provide real-time progress tracking and business value measurement
6. **Adapt Dynamically**: Respond to changing conditions and emergent priorities

### Intelligence-Driven Decision Making

The swarm uses collective intelligence to determine:
- **Team Formation**: Based on current capability gaps and workload analysis
- **Work Prioritization**: Using business value, risk assessment, and strategic alignment
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing for PI objectives and sprint goals
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic escalation and resource reallocation when critical issues arise
- **Continuous Improvement**: Proactive enhancement initiatives during low-priority periods

    update_team_coordination_before_shutdown
    
    # Handoff any critical work to team members
    coordinate_work_handoff_to_team
