## üìö Command Usage Patterns

### Agent Initialization Flow:
```bash
/project:init-agent              # Determine role and join swarm
/project:check-handoffs          # Check coordination status
/project:claim-work              # Take on specific work
/project:send-message            # Coordinate with other agents
```

### Development Workflow:
```bash
/project:system-health           # Check system before starting
/project:tdd-cycle               # Follow test-driven development
/project:debug-system            # Resolve issues as they arise
/project:memory-session          # Document patterns and learnings
```

### Continuous Improvement:
```bash
/project:discover-enhancements   # Find improvement opportunities
/project:next-enhancement        # Get prioritized recommendations
/project:implement-enhancement   # Execute improvements
/project:workflow-health         # Monitor automation effectiveness
```

### Autonomous Mode:
```bash
/project:auto                    # Let AI analyze and act intelligently
```

## üéØ Command Categories

**Coordination Commands**: Enable AI agent swarm coordination following APS protocol
**Development Commands**: Support test-driven development and debugging workflows
**Enhancement Commands**: Automate system improvement and optimization
**Memory Commands**: Preserve context and knowledge across sessions
**Auto Commands**: Enable autonomous operation with strategic thinking

## üìñ Getting Started

1. **Initialize**: Run `/project:init-agent` to join the agent swarm
2. **Check Status**: Use `/project:check-handoffs` to see current work
3. **Take Action**: Claim work with `/project:claim-work` or create new processes
4. **Coordinate**: Use `/project:send-message` to communicate with other agents
5. **Improve**: Run `/project:discover-enhancements` to find optimization opportunities

## üîß Advanced Usage

- **Autonomous Mode**: Use `/project:auto` for intelligent, self-directed operation
- **Memory Management**: Use `/project:memory-session` to preserve context
- **Health Monitoring**: Regular `/project:system-health` checks ensure stability
- **TDD Workflow**: Follow `/project:tdd-cycle` for robust development practices

## üìã Best Practices

- Always start with `/project:init-agent` to establish proper coordination
- Use `/project:check-handoffs` regularly to maintain swarm coordination
- Document learnings with `/project:memory-session` for knowledge preservation
- Follow APS protocol for all inter-agent communication and workflow
- Leverage autonomous mode for complex analysis and strategic action
