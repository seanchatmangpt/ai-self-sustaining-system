## üìö Command Usage Patterns

### Primary Autonomous Operation:
```bash
/project:auto                    # Complete autonomous swarm operation
                                # - Analyzes system state automatically
                                # - Forms optimal teams based on needs
                                # - Claims and executes highest-value work
                                # - Coordinates via Scrum at Scale
                                # - Adapts to changing priorities
```

### Advanced Swarm Coordination:
```bash
/project:swarm-coordinate        # Advanced team formation and collective intelligence
/project:claim-work              # Intelligent work discovery and claiming
/project:check-handoffs          # Monitor swarm coordination status
```

### Supporting Operations:
```bash
/project:system-health           # Comprehensive system analysis
/project:debug-system            # AI-assisted issue resolution
/project:discover-enhancements   # Proactive improvement identification
/project:memory-session          # Knowledge preservation and learning
```

### Enterprise Integration:
```bash
# All commands integrate with:
# - Scrum at Scale events (PI Planning, System Demos, etc.)
# - Enterprise coordination system (nanosecond precision)
# - JTBD workflows (customer value optimization)
# - Real-time telemetry and business value measurement
```

## üéØ Command Categories

**Coordination Commands**: Enable AI agent swarm coordination following APS protocol
**Development Commands**: Support test-driven development and debugging workflows
**Enhancement Commands**: Automate system improvement and optimization
**Memory Commands**: Preserve context and knowledge across sessions
**Auto Commands**: Enable autonomous operation with strategic thinking

## üìñ Getting Started

1. **Initialize**: Run `/project:init-agent` to join the agent swarm
2. **Check Status**: Use `/project:check-handoffs` to see current work
3. **Take Action**: Claim work with `/project:claim-work` or create new processes
4. **Coordinate**: Use `/project:send-message` to communicate with other agents
5. **Improve**: Run `/project:discover-enhancements` to find optimization opportunities

## üîß Advanced Usage

- **Autonomous Mode**: Use `/project:auto` for intelligent, self-directed operation
- **Memory Management**: Use `/project:memory-session` to preserve context
- **Health Monitoring**: Regular `/project:system-health` checks ensure stability
- **TDD Workflow**: Follow `/project:tdd-cycle` for robust development practices

## üìã Best Practices

- Always start with `/project:init-agent` to establish proper coordination
- Use `/project:check-handoffs` regularly to maintain swarm coordination
- Document learnings with `/project:memory-session` for knowledge preservation
- Follow APS protocol for all inter-agent communication and workflow
- Leverage autonomous mode for complex analysis and strategic action
