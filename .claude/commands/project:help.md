# AI Agent Swarm Command System

**Purpose**: Show help and documentation for all available commands.

```bash
/project:help [command_name]
```

## ü§ñ Agent Swarm Coordination Commands

### Core Agent Management
- **`/project:init-agent`** - Initialize agent role and join swarm coordination system
- **`/project:auto`** - Autonomous AI agent: analyze, think strategically, and act continuously
- **`/project:check-handoffs`** - Monitor pending work and inter-agent coordination status

### Process & Work Management
- **`/project:create-aps`** - Create new APS process specification for workflow coordination
- **`/project:claim-work`** - Claim specific APS process to prevent agent conflicts
- **`/project:send-message`** - Send structured message to another agent following APS protocol

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Debugging Commands

### System Health & Debugging
- **`/project:system-health`** - Comprehensive system status and health monitoring
- **`/project:debug-system`** - AI-assisted debugging across Phoenix, n8n, and infrastructure
- **`/project:tdd-cycle`** - Test-driven development workflow following TDD best practices

## üöÄ Enhancement & Optimization Commands

### AI-Powered Improvements
- **`/project:discover-enhancements`** - AI-powered system improvement identification
- **`/project:implement-enhancement`** - Automated enhancement implementation with quality gates

## üß† Memory & Documentation Commands

### Knowledge Management
- **`/project:memory-session`** - Session memory and knowledge management for continuity

## Command Usage Syntax
All commands follow the pattern: `/project:[command-name] [optional-arguments]`

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initialize as an AI Agent
```bash
/project:init-agent
```
This automatically determines your optimal agent role based on current system state.

### 2. Check System Health
```bash
/project:system-health
```
Comprehensive health check across all system components.

### 3. Start Autonomous Operation
```bash
/project:auto
```
Begin continuous autonomous operation with infinite loop mode.

### 4. Create New Process
```bash
/project:create-aps "Feature_Name" "Feature Description"
```
Generate structured APS workflow for new features.

### 5. Claim Work
```bash
/project:claim-work
```
Interactive selection of available work matching your agent role.

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### üéØ PM_Agent (Product Manager)
- Translate high-level goals into machine-readable APS requirements
- Generate Gherkin scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Manage product backlog and feature prioritization

### üèóÔ∏è Architect_Agent
- Design system architecture based on APS requirements
- Create C4 model definitions and technical specifications
- Define non-functional requirements and tech stack choices

### üíª Developer_Agent
- Implement code based on architectural and Gherkin specifications
- Write source code files and corresponding unit tests
- Commit code and prepare for QA handoff

### üß™ QA_Agent
- Validate implemented features against Gherkin scenarios
- Generate test results and bug reports
- Ensure quality gates are met before deployment

### üöÄ DevOps_Agent
- Manage CI/CD pipeline, deployment, and operational monitoring
- Deploy features to production and monitor their health
- Trigger self-adaptation loops based on telemetry data

## Autonomous Operation Features

### Infinite Loop Mode
The `/project:auto` command runs continuously, never stopping until explicitly commanded:
- **Cycle Duration**: 30-second intervals between cycles
- **Stop Conditions**: `STOP`, `EXIT`, `HALT`, `SHUTDOWN` commands
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment
- **Enhancement Discovery**: Automated improvement identification
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic issue detection and resolution

### Success Metrics
- System health improvements and issue resolution
- Enhanced agent coordination and workflow efficiency
- Successful completion of assigned tasks and handoffs
- Knowledge capture and institutional learning
- Strategic progress toward self-sustaining system goals
