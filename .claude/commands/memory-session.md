AI context and memory management following Anthropic teams' memory and documentation patterns.

Memory operation: $ARGUMENTS (optional: specific memory type or operation)

Memory Management Options:
1. **Create Session Memory Context**:
   - Initialize session tracking with unique ID
   - Document session purpose, goals, and key context
   - Create progress tracking structure
   - Set up decision and pattern logging

2. **Update CLAUDE.md Documentation**:
   - Add new workflow patterns and procedures
   - Document tool usage instructions and best practices
   - Include debugging guidance and troubleshooting steps
   - Update agent coordination protocols

3. **Generate Workflow Runbooks**:
   - Create debugging runbooks for common issues
   - Document deployment procedures and checklists
   - Generate feature development workflows
   - Establish incident response procedures

4. **Create Pattern Templates**:
   - Phoenix LiveView component patterns
   - n8n workflow node templates
   - Test pattern libraries and examples
   - Error handling and API integration patterns

5. **Log Improvement Hypotheses**:
   - Track experiments and system improvements
   - Document hypothesis testing methods
   - Record results and impact measurements
   - Maintain future enhancement ideas

6. **Session Summary & Handoff**:
   - Document session accomplishments and progress
   - Create handoff notes for session continuity
   - Update key learnings in CLAUDE.md
   - Provide context for next session or agent

Memory Features:
- Session context preservation across interactions
- Pattern template generation for reusability
- Runbook creation for operational excellence
- Hypothesis tracking for continuous improvement
- Handoff documentation for seamless transitions

Integration with AI Swarm:
- Link memory context to APS processes
- Share patterns via inter-agent messages
- Document coordination protocols and lessons learned
- Maintain institutional knowledge across agent sessions

Best Practices from Anthropic Teams:
- End-of-session documentation updates (Data Infrastructure)
- Plain text workflow descriptions (Data Infrastructure)
- Documentation synthesis for efficiency (Security Engineering)
- Visual-first approach with screenshots (Legal)
- Incremental work with context preservation (Product Design)

Output Format:
- Markdown files for documentation
- YAML structures for process memory
- Template files for reusable patterns
- Summary reports for handoffs

The memory system ensures continuity and learning across agent sessions while building institutional knowledge for the AI swarm.
