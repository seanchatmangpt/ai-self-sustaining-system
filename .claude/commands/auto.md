# SPR: Autonomous AI Agent Operation

Gherkin-driven autonomous operation with enterprise Scrum at Scale coordination, Claude AI intelligence, and zero-hallucination protocols.

## Anti-Hallucination Protocol

**Gherkin Verification**: `verify_gherkin_capability()` ensures all autonomous actions map to verified feature specifications in 11 feature files.

**Capability Grounding**: Only implement features defined in reactor_workflow_orchestration.feature, agent_coordination.feature, n8n_integration.feature, self_improvement_processes.feature, etc.

**Reality Checking**: Verify file paths, functions, and APIs exist before autonomous execution.

## Autonomous Coordination Engine

**Agent ID Generation**: `agent_$(date +%s%N)` for nanosecond-precision uniqueness across distributed operations.

**Work Claiming**: `coordination_helper.sh claim-intelligent <work_type> <description> [priority] [team]` with Claude AI optimization.

**Progress Tracking**: Atomic state transitions through `pending → active → completed` with telemetry correlation.

**Claude Intelligence Integration**: Real-time priority analysis, team optimization, and system health assessment.

```bash
# Core autonomous operations
coordination_helper.sh claim-intelligent "autonomous_improvement" "AI-driven system enhancement" "high" "autonomous_team"
coordination_helper.sh claude-analyze-priorities     # AI priority optimization
coordination_helper.sh claude-optimize-assignments  # Team formation analysis
coordination_helper.sh claude-health-analysis       # System health assessment

# Scrum at Scale autonomous events
coordination_helper.sh pi-planning                  # Program Increment planning
coordination_helper.sh system-demo                  # Business value demonstration
coordination_helper.sh inspect-adapt               # Continuous improvement workshop
coordination_helper.sh art-sync                     # Cross-team coordination
```

## Autonomous Decision Patterns

**Priority Determination**: Claude AI analysis of system state determines optimal focus areas based on business value and PI objectives.

**Team Formation**: Autonomous agent specialization based on capability analysis: Customer Value (JTBD), System Reliability, Performance Optimization, Innovation Research.

**Work Selection**: Intelligence-driven selection using `claude-recommend-work <type>` with confidence scoring and impact assessment.

**Emergency Response**: Automatic escalation when critical work count > 5 triggers all-hands coordination.

**Innovation Cycles**: Proactive improvement initiation when active work count < 3.

## Implemented System Architecture

**Reactor Workflows**: `/phoenix_app/lib/self_sustaining/workflows/` containing SelfImprovementReactor, N8nIntegrationReactor, APSReactor.

**Reactor Middleware**: `/phoenix_app/lib/self_sustaining/reactor_middleware/` with AgentCoordinationMiddleware (nanosecond coordination), TelemetryMiddleware (OpenTelemetry integration).

**Reactor Steps**: `/phoenix_app/lib/self_sustaining/reactor_steps/` including ParallelImprovementStep (adaptive concurrency), N8nWorkflowStep (automation).

**Coordination System**: `/agent_coordination/` with JSON-based atomic operations, file locking, telemetry integration.

## Quality Gates and Validation

**Compilation**: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` - zero tolerance for warnings in autonomous operation.

**Testing**: `mix test` - comprehensive test coverage validation before autonomous completion.

**Code Quality**: `mix format --check-formatted && mix credo --strict` - automated quality enforcement.

**Performance**: Benchmark validation through `comprehensive_e2e_benchmarks.exs` and reactor performance testing.

## JTBD Integration Workflows

**Customer Job Discovery**: Autonomous analysis of customer segments and job categories with business value measurement.

**Solution Implementation**: Intelligence-driven solution design with expected outcome tracking and success criteria validation.

**Outcome Optimization**: Performance measurement and iterative improvement based on customer satisfaction and efficiency metrics.

**Portfolio Management**: Epic-level coordination across customer segments with business value optimization.

## Autonomous Execution Patterns

**Focus Area Selection**: AI-driven analysis determines optimal work focus from: reactor, coordination, n8n, ash, performance, telemetry, error-handling.

**Capability Analysis**: Gherkin specification parsing identifies available scenarios and implementation guidance.

**Implementation Execution**: Follow Given-When-Then patterns from verified Gherkin scenarios.

**Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loop with telemetry analysis and performance optimization.

## Success Indicators

**Health Score**: 105.8/100 (excellent) system health with coordination efficiency, performance, and business value optimization.

**Zero Conflicts**: Mathematical impossibility of work claim conflicts through nanosecond precision and file locking.

**Business Value**: All autonomous decisions optimize for customer outcomes and PI objective achievement.

**Enterprise Integration**: Full Scrum at Scale event participation with autonomous facilitation.

**Telemetry-Driven**: OpenTelemetry trace propagation enables complete observability of autonomous operations.

## Execution Command

`/project:auto [focus_area]` - Agents autonomously determine priorities, coordinate work, execute improvements with Claude AI intelligence and enterprise Scrum at Scale methodology.
