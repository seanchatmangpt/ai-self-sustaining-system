# Enterprise Sprint Work Claiming System

**Purpose**: Atomic work claiming from sprint backlog with nanosecond precision and zero-conflict guarantee using YAML-first coordination.

```bash
/project:claim-work [work_item_id] [team]
```

## Enterprise Scrum at Scale Features
- **Nanosecond Precision Claims**: Mathematically unique work item IDs with atomic claiming
- **YAML-First Coordination**: All work claims stored in `agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml`
- **Sprint Context Awareness**: Claims work from current sprint backlog aligned with PI objectives
- **Team Velocity Integration**: Contributes to team velocity and burndown tracking
- **Zero-Conflict Guarantee**: Atomic operations prevent double work assignment

## Sprint Work Discovery Process

### 1. Current Sprint Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current sprint context and team commitments
analyze_current_sprint() {
    CURRENT_SPRINT="sprint_$(date +%Y)_$(date +%U)"
    CURRENT_PI="PI_$(date +%Y)_Q$(($(date +%-m-1)/3+1))"
    
    # Get sprint backlog from YAML coordination system
    sprint_stories=$(yq eval '.current_sprint.team_commitments' agent_coordination/backlog.yaml)
    sprint_goal=$(yq eval '.current_sprint.goal' agent_coordination/backlog.yaml)
    
    echo "Current Sprint: $CURRENT_SPRINT"
    echo "Sprint Goal: $sprint_goal"
}
```

### 2. Team-Specific Work Identification
```yaml
# Available work by Scrum at Scale team
team_work_assignments:
  coordination_team:
    focus: "Agent coordination, impediment removal, Scrum facilitation"
    available_work:
      - "Sprint planning coordination"
      - "Cross-team dependency resolution"
      - "Velocity optimization initiatives"
      - "Daily Scrum facilitation"
      
  development_team:
    focus: "Feature implementation, story completion, technical quality"
    available_work:
      - "User story implementation"
      - "Bug fixes and technical debt"
      - "Automated test development"
      - "Code review and quality gates"
      
  platform_team:
    focus: "Infrastructure, deployment, system reliability"
    available_work:
      - "CI/CD pipeline optimization"
      - "Infrastructure automation"
      - "Security and compliance"
      - "System monitoring and alerting"
      
  autonomous_team:
    focus: "Cross-team support, high-priority initiatives"
    available_work:
      - "Critical PI objective support"
      - "Emergency response coordination"
      - "Cross-functional problem solving"
      - "System-wide improvement initiatives"
```

### 3. Atomic Work Claiming with Nanosecond Precision
```bash
# Zero-conflict work claiming protocol
claim_sprint_work() {
    # Generate nanosecond-precision work item ID
    WORK_ITEM_ID="work_$(date +%s%N)"
    AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"
    CLAIM_TIMESTAMP="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
    
    # Atomic claim operation using YAML coordination
    claim_work_atomically() {
        # Use coordination helper for atomic operations
        agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh claim \
            "$work_type" \
            "$work_description" \
            "$priority" \
            "$agent_team"
        
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "✅ Successfully claimed work: $WORK_ITEM_ID"
            register_work_claim_in_yaml
        else
            echo "❌ Work claim failed - already assigned or conflict detected"
            suggest_alternative_work
        fi
    }
}
```

### 4. YAML Coordination System Integration
```yaml
# agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml structure

active_claims:
  - work_item_id: "work_1749970490597398001"

    work_type: "user_story_implementation"
    priority: "high"

    scrum_at_scale:
      sprint: "sprint_2025_15"
      pi: "PI_2025_Q2"
      art: "AI_Self_Sustaining_ART"
      story_points: 13
      sprint_goal_alignment: true
    progress:
      status: "in_progress"
      completion_percentage: 0
      last_updated: "2025-06-15T06:54:00Z"
    quality_gates:
      definition_of_done_checklist: []
      acceptance_criteria_status: "pending"
      test_coverage_target: 90
```

### 5. Team Velocity and Sprint Contribution
```bash
# Track contribution to team velocity
track_velocity_contribution() {
    story_points=$(yq eval '.active_claims[] | select(.work_item_id == "'$WORK_ITEM_ID'") | .scrum_at_scale.story_points' agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml)
    
    # Update team velocity tracking
    yq eval '.teams[] | select(.name == "'$AGENT_TEAM'") | .current_sprint_velocity += '$story_points'' -i agent_coordination/backlog.yaml
    
    # Contribute to sprint burndown
    update_sprint_burndown "$story_points" "claimed"
}
```

## Conflict Resolution and Quality Gates

### Zero-Conflict Guarantee Protocol
```bash
# Atomic claim verification with rollback capability
verify_claim_success() {
    # Re-read coordination state to verify claim success
    claimed_agent=$(yq eval '.active_claims[] | select(.work_item_id == "'$WORK_ITEM_ID'") | .agent_id' agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml)
    
    if [ "$claimed_agent" == "$AGENT_ID" ]; then
        echo "✅ Claim verified successfully"
        begin_work_execution
    else
        echo "❌ Claim conflict detected - work assigned to different agent"
        rollback_claim_attempt
        suggest_alternative_work
    fi
}
```

### Definition of Done Integration
```bash
# Ensure work meets ART-level Definition of Done
enforce_definition_of_done() {
    # Load ART-level DoD requirements
    dod_requirements=$(yq eval '.art_definition_of_done' CLAUDE.md)
    
    # Create DoD checklist for claimed work
    create_dod_checklist() {
        yq eval '.active_claims[] | select(.work_item_id == "'$WORK_ITEM_ID'") | .quality_gates.definition_of_done_checklist = [
            "unit_tests_90_percent_coverage",
            "integration_tests_critical_paths",
            "code_review_approved",
            "static_analysis_passed",
            "api_compatibility_verified",
            "performance_objectives_met",
            "security_scan_passed",
            "documentation_updated"
        ]' -i agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Work Selection
```bash
/project:claim-work                           # Show available work for current team
/project:claim-work coordination_team         # Show coordination team work
/project:claim-work development_team          # Show development team work
/project:claim-work platform_team             # Show platform team work
```

### Direct Work Claiming
```bash
/project:claim-work work_1749970490597398001  # Claim specific work item
/project:claim-work high_priority             # Claim highest priority available work
/project:claim-work sprint_goal               # Claim work aligned with sprint goal
```

### Emergency and Critical Work
```bash
/project:claim-work emergency                 # Claim critical PI objective work
/project:claim-work impediment               # Claim impediment removal work
/project:claim-work cross_team               # Claim cross-team coordination work
```

## Enterprise Coordination Benefits

### Mathematical Uniqueness Guarantee

- **Atomic Operations**: YAML-based coordination prevents race conditions
- **Collision-Free Scaling**: Supports unlimited concurrent agents

### Scrum at Scale Integration
- **PI Objective Alignment**: All work contributes to Program Increment goals
- **Team Velocity Tracking**: Real-time contribution to sprint burndown
- **Cross-Team Coordination**: Seamless dependency management
- **ART Metrics**: Automated contribution to Release Train metrics

### Quality and Compliance
- **Definition of Done**: Automatic enforcement of quality standards
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Structured validation requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete work claim and progress logging
- **Performance Metrics**: Velocity and quality trend analysis

This enterprise work claiming system transforms individual agent work into coordinated team contributions that directly support sprint goals, PI objectives, and overall ART success metrics.
