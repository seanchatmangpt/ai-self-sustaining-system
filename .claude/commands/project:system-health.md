```bash
# Enhanced system monitoring with ART context
monitor_system_infrastructure() {
    # PostgreSQL Database Health
    check_postgresql_health() {
        connection_status=$(pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432)

        echo "Active Connections: $active_connections"
        
        # Database performance impact on team velocity
        db_performance_impact=$(check_db_impact_on_velocity)
        echo "Velocity Impact: $db_performance_impact"
    }
    
    # Phoenix Application Health with Team Impact

            echo "🚨 High disk usage may impact agent performance"
        fi
    }
}
```

### 6. Quality Gates and Definition of Done Health
```bash
# Monitor adherence to ART-level quality standards
monitor_quality_health() {
    # Code quality metrics
    test_coverage=$(mix test --cover | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*%' | tail -1)
    compilation_warnings=$(mix compile 2>&1 | grep -c "warning")
    credo_issues=$(mix credo --strict | grep -c "issue")
    
    echo "Test Coverage: $test_coverage (Target: 90%+)"
    echo "Compilation Warnings: $compilation_warnings (Target: 0)"
    echo "Credo Issues: $credo_issues (Target: 0)"
    
    # Definition of Done compliance rate
    completed_work=$(yq eval '.active_claims[] | select(.progress.status == "completed")' agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml | wc -l)
    dod_compliant=$(yq eval '.active_claims[] | select(.quality_gates.definition_of_done_checklist | length > 0)' agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml | wc -l)
    
    if [ "$completed_work" -gt 0 ]; then
        dod_compliance_rate=$(echo "scale=2; $dod_compliant / $completed_work * 100" | bc)
        echo "Definition of Done Compliance: $dod_compliance_rate%"
    fi
}
```

## Health Status Levels with ART Context

### System Health Status
- **✅ Healthy**: All systems operational, teams on track for PI objectives
- **⚠️ Warning**: Minor issues detected, team velocity slightly impacted
- **🔶 Degraded**: Performance impact present, sprint commitments at risk
- **❌ Error**: Critical issues requiring attention, PI objectives threatened
- **🚨 Critical**: System failure, emergency ART coordination required
- **⬇️ Down**: Complete service unavailability, all teams blocked

### ART Health Indicators
```yaml
art_health_thresholds:
  healthy:
    predictability: ">= 80%"
    velocity_variance: "< 20%"
    sprint_goal_achievement: ">= 85%"
    coordination_conflicts: "0"
    
  warning:
    predictability: "70-79%"
    velocity_variance: "20-30%"
    sprint_goal_achievement: "75-84%"
    coordination_conflicts: "1-2"
    
  critical:
    predictability: "< 70%"
    velocity_variance: "> 30%"
    sprint_goal_achievement: "< 75%"
    coordination_conflicts: "> 2"
```

/project:system-health teams              # Team coordination health
/project:system-health infrastructure     # Traditional system health
```

### Team-Specific Health Checks
```bash

```

## Enterprise Health Dashboard

### Real-Time ART Dashboard
```bash
# Generate comprehensive ART health dashboard
generate_art_dashboard() {
    echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
    echo "           🏢 ENTERPRISE ART HEALTH DASHBOARD"
    echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
    
    # PI Health Overview
    echo "📊 PROGRAM INCREMENT HEALTH:"
    monitor_sprint_health
    
    echo ""
    echo "👥 TEAM VELOCITY & COORDINATION:"
    monitor_coordination_health
    
    echo ""
    echo "🔧 SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE:"
    monitor_system_infrastructure
    
    echo ""
    echo "✅ QUALITY & COMPLIANCE:"
    monitor_quality_health
    
    echo "═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
}
```

### Automated Health Alerts
```bash
# Automated alerting for ART health issues
check_health_alerts() {
    # Critical PI objective risk
    if pi_objective_at_risk; then
        alert_rte_agent "PI objective at risk - immediate intervention required"
    fi
    
    # Team velocity degradation
    if team_velocity_declining; then
        alert_scrum_masters "Team velocity declining - impediment analysis needed"
    fi
    
    # Coordination conflicts detected
    conflicts=$(./agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh conflicts)
    if [ "$conflicts" -gt 0 ]; then
        alert_coordination_team "$conflicts coordination conflicts require resolution"
    fi
}
```

## Enterprise Benefits

### Scrum at Scale Integration
- **ART Metrics**: Real-time Program Increment and team performance monitoring
- **Predictability Tracking**: Continuous measurement of PI commitment delivery
- **Cross-Team Visibility**: Comprehensive view of dependencies and coordination
- **Velocity Optimization**: Data-driven insights for continuous improvement

### Proactive Issue Detection
- **Early Warning System**: Identifies risks before they impact PI objectives
- **Automated Alerting**: Notifies appropriate agents of health degradation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Correlates system health with team performance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 health surveillance with intelligent thresholds

This enterprise system health monitoring transforms traditional infrastructure monitoring into a comprehensive ART health management system that directly supports Scrum at Scale success metrics and PI objective achievement.
