- WebSocket connection stability

### 4. Dependencies and Compilation
- Mix dependency resolution status
- Compilation warnings and errors
- Asset compilation status
- Module loading verification

### 5. System Resources

## Health Check Implementation
- **Automated Diagnostics**: Systematic health verification
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical health trend identification
- **Alert Generation**: Proactive issue notification
- **Recovery Recommendations**: Automated fix suggestions

## Health Status Levels
- **‚úÖ Healthy**: All systems operational
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Minor issues detected
- **üî∂ Degraded**: Performance impact present
- **‚ùå Error**: Critical issues requiring attention
- **üö® Critical**: System failure or unavailable
- **‚¨áÔ∏è Down**: Complete service unavailability

## Usage Examples
```bash
/project:system-health              # Full system health check
/project:system-health database     # Database-specific health
/project:system-health phoenix      # Phoenix application health
/project:system-health n8n          # n8n workflow engine health
```
