# SPR: Project-Level Coordination Operations

Enterprise AI agent swarm coordination with Claude AI intelligence, Scrum at Scale integration, and comprehensive shell command automation.

## Coordination Command Patterns

**Atomic Work Operations**: `coordination_helper.sh claim|progress|complete` with nanosecond-precision agent IDs and zero-conflict file locking.

**Claude AI Integration**: `claude-analyze-priorities|claude-optimize-assignments|claude-health-analysis` with structured JSON validation and retry logic.

**Scrum at Scale Events**: `pi-planning|art-sync|system-demo|inspect-adapt` with autonomous facilitation and business value measurement.

**Telemetry-Driven**: OpenTelemetry trace propagation across all operations with performance monitoring and health scoring.

## Shell Command Architecture

**Coordination Helper**: `/agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh` - comprehensive coordination automation with 40+ subcommands.

**JSON Coordination**: File-based atomic operations in `work_claims.json`, `agent_status.json`, `coordination_log.json` with locking mechanisms.

**Intelligence Pipeline**: Claude AI analysis with Unix-style piping, real-time streaming, and enhanced error handling.

**Enterprise Events**: Full Scrum at Scale ceremony automation including PI Planning, Portfolio Kanban, Value Stream Mapping.

## Operational Primitives

**Agent ID Generation**: `agent_$(date +%s%N)` ensures mathematical uniqueness across distributed swarm operations.

**Work State Transitions**: `pending → active → completed` with atomic updates and telemetry correlation.

**Team Formation**: Autonomous specialization: Customer Value, System Reliability, Performance Optimization, Innovation Research.

**Business Value Focus**: All coordination optimizes for PI objectives, customer outcomes, and ART velocity metrics.

## System Integration Points

**Phoenix Application**: LiveView dashboards, REST APIs, health endpoints with comprehensive error handling.

**Reactor Workflows**: Pure Reactor patterns with AgentCoordinationMiddleware and TelemetryMiddleware integration.

**N8n Automation**: Workflow compilation, export, execution with telemetry tracking and error recovery.

**Performance Monitoring**: Real-time health scoring (105.8/100), 148 coordination ops/hour, zero conflicts achieved.

## Quality Assurance

**Anti-Hallucination**: Gherkin feature verification before autonomous execution prevents implementation of non-existent capabilities.

**Testing Integration**: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors && mix test` validation with comprehensive coverage requirements.

**Continuous Monitoring**: Automated health checks, performance regression detection, and capacity planning.

**Enterprise Compliance**: Full audit trails, coordination logging, and business value measurement for stakeholder reporting.
