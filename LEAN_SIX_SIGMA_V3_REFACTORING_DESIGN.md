## PHASE 3: ANALYZE

### 3.1 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

#### **Primary Problem**: Architectural Over-Engineering
**Fishbone Diagram Analysis**:

silos           automation       paths             across worktrees
```

#### **Five Whys Analysis**:

**Problem**: Claude AI integration has 100% failure rate
1. **Why?** API integration commands are broken
2. **Why?** No error handling or recovery mechanisms implemented
3. **Why?** Integration was built without testing framework
4. **Why?** No clear integration testing requirements defined
5. **Why?** System was built without production readiness criteria

**Root Cause**: Lack of production readiness definition and testing standards

#### **Pareto Analysis** (80/20 Rule)
```yaml
80% of Problems Caused by 20% of Issues:
  1. Claude AI Integration Failure (35% of total issues)
  2. Script Duplication Waste (25% of total issues)
  3. XAVOS Deployment Reliability (20% of total issues)
  
Total: 80% of problems from 3 critical issues
```
