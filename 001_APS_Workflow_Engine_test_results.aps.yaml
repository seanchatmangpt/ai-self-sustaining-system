qa_agent_notes: |
  The APS Workflow Engine implementation successfully meets all core requirements 
  defined in the Gherkin scenarios. The system can parse APS files, manage agent 
  handoffs, and track process state as designed. Code quality is good with only
  minor warnings that don't affect functionality.
  
  Ready for DevOps deployment and monitoring phase.
