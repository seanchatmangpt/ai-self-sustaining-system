## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Document Consolidation** (Week 1)

**Day 1-2: Assessment and Planning**
```bash
# Audit current V3 documentation
find . -name "*v3*" -o -name "*V3*" | grep -E "\.(md|txt)$" > v3_docs_inventory.txt

# Categorize by purpose and overlap
./scripts/analyze-documentation-overlap.sh

# Create consolidation plan
./scripts/create-documentation-consolidation-plan.sh
```

**Day 3-4: Content Extraction and Synthesis**
```bash
# Extract key content from existing documents
./scripts/extract-v3-documentation-content.sh

# Create master strategy document
./scripts/create-master-v3-strategy.sh

# Synthesize implementation playbook
./scripts/create-implementation-playbook.sh
```

**Day 5: Validation and Rollout**
```bash
# Validate new structure with stakeholders
./scripts/validate-documentation-structure.sh

# Archive old documentation
./scripts/archive-legacy-v3-docs.sh

# Update navigation and references
