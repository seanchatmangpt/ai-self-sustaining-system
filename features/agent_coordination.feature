Feature: Agent Coordination with Zero-Conflict Guarantees
  As an AI Agent Swarm
  I want nanosecond-precision coordination with mathematical zero-conflict guarantees
  So that I can achieve perfect coordination without any work conflicts

  Background:
    Given the Agent Coordination Middleware is active
    And the coordination directory "agent_coordination" exists
    And all agents use nanosecond-precision IDs

  @critical @coordination
  Scenario: Atomic Work Claiming with Zero Conflicts
    Given 5 agents are trying to claim the same work item simultaneously
    And each agent has a unique nanosecond-precision ID
    When all agents attempt to claim work atomically
    Then exactly 1 agent should successfully claim the work
    And 4 agents should receive conflict errors
    And no work item should be claimed by multiple agents
    And the work claim should be recorded with full metadata

  @critical @coordination
  Scenario: Nanosecond-Precision Agent ID Generation
    Given I need to generate 1000 agent IDs rapidly
    When I generate agent IDs using the coordination middleware
    Then all 1000 IDs should be unique
    And each ID should include nanosecond timestamp
    And ID generation should take less than 1 millisecond per ID
    And IDs should be sortable by creation time

  @coordination @retry
  Scenario: Exponential Backoff on Work Conflicts
    Given an agent encounters a work claim conflict
    And the agent is configured with max_retries: 3
    When the agent retries claiming work
    Then the first retry should wait approximately 1 second
    And the second retry should wait approximately 2 seconds
    And the third retry should wait approximately 4 seconds
    And each retry should include random jitter
    And the agent should fail after 3 unsuccessful retries

  @coordination @scrum
  Scenario: Scrum at Scale Agent Assignment
    Given I have a complex multi-team workflow
    And the workflow requires PM_Agent, Architect_Agent, and Developer_Agent
    And multiple agents are available for each role
    When the workflow starts
    Then agents should be assigned atomically without conflicts
    And each role should have exactly one assigned agent
    And agent assignments should be recorded with timestamps
    And handoff coordination should be prepared

  @coordination @handoff
  Scenario: Agent-to-Agent Work Handoff
    Given PM_Agent has completed requirement analysis
    And the work is ready for handoff to Architect_Agent
    And multiple Architect_Agents are available
    When PM_Agent triggers handoff
    Then exactly one Architect_Agent should claim the handoff
    And the PM_Agent's work should be marked as completed
    And handoff metadata should include all artifacts
    And the next agent should have full context

  @coordination @monitoring
  Scenario: Real-time Coordination Monitoring
    Given multiple agents are working on different tasks
    And coordination monitoring is enabled
    When I query the coordination status
    Then I should see all active work claims
    And each claim should show agent ID, work type, and progress
    And completion estimates should be accurate
    And system should detect any coordination anomalies

  @coordination @recovery
  Scenario: Coordination Failure Recovery
    Given an agent crashes while holding a work claim
    And the work claim has been active for over 30 minutes
    When the coordination system detects the stale claim
    Then the stale claim should be automatically released
    And the work should become available for other agents
    And failure telemetry should be recorded
    And recovery actions should be logged

  @coordination @performance
  Scenario: High-Performance Coordination Under Load
    Given 50 agents are simultaneously requesting work
    And the system is under high load (80% CPU)
    When all agents attempt coordination operations
    Then all coordination operations should complete within 5 seconds
    And no deadlocks should occur
    And coordination file integrity should be maintained
    And performance metrics should be within acceptable ranges

  @coordination @isolation
  Scenario: Work Claim Process Isolation
    Given multiple processes are running concurrent ReactorAgentworkflows
    And each process has its own agent coordination context
    When processes execute coordination operations
    Then each process should maintain separate coordination state
    And cross-process coordination should not interfere
    And work claims should be process-scoped appropriately
    And coordination telemetry should track process boundaries

  @coordination @file-locking
  Scenario: Atomic File-Based Coordination
    Given the coordination system uses file-based work claims
    And multiple agents are writing to the coordination file simultaneously
    When agents perform atomic claim operations
    Then file operations should use proper locking mechanisms
    And no coordination data should be corrupted
    And all claim operations should be atomic
    And file integrity should be maintained under concurrent access

  @coordination @telemetry
  Scenario: Comprehensive Coordination Telemetry
    Given coordination telemetry is enabled
    And an agent completes a full work lifecycle
    When I review the telemetry data
    Then telemetry should include claim timestamps
    And execution duration should be recorded
    And agent utilization metrics should be available
    And coordination conflict rates should be tracked
    And ART velocity metrics should be updated

  @coordination @escalation
  Scenario: Coordination Error Escalation
    Given an agent encounters repeated coordination failures
    And the failure count exceeds the threshold
    When coordination failure escalation triggers
    Then the failure should be escalated to monitoring systems
    And detailed failure context should be captured
    And alternative coordination strategies should be attempted
    And human operators should be notified if needed

  @coordination @multi-agent
  Scenario: Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination
    Given I have a complex workflow requiring 5 different agent types
    And each agent type has specific coordination requirements
    When the multi-agent workflow executes
    Then all agents should coordinate without conflicts
    And agent dependencies should be respected
    And parallel work should be maximized where possible
    And cross-agent communication should be coordinated
    And the swarm should complete work efficiently
