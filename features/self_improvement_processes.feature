    And the system can execute parallel improvements
    And improvement validation is enabled

  @critical @self-improvement
  Scenario: Analyze Current System State
    Given the system has been running for at least 1 hour
    And performance metrics are being collected
    When I trigger system state analysis
    Then current metrics should be captured accurately
    And improvement areas should be identified
    And priority scores should be calculated
    And analysis should complete within 30 seconds

  @critical @self-improvement
  Scenario: Generate Improvement Plan
    Given system analysis has identified improvement opportunities
    And the analysis includes performance, security, and quality areas
    When I generate an improvement plan
    Then the plan should prioritize improvements by impact
    And effort estimates should be provided for each improvement
    And expected benefits should be quantified
    And implementation steps should be detailed

  @critical @self-improvement
  Scenario: Execute Parallel Improvements
    Given I have a validated improvement plan with 4 improvements
    And system load allows for parallel execution
    When I execute the improvement plan
    Then all 4 improvements should run concurrently
    And each improvement should operate independently
    And execution should use adaptive concurrency control
    And progress should be monitored in real-time

  @self-improvement @validation
  Scenario: Validate Improvement Plan
    Given I have an improvement plan with estimated 8-hour duration
    And the plan includes high-risk changes
    When I validate the improvement plan
    Then safety checks should verify feasibility
    And resource availability should be confirmed
    And rollback plans should be verified
    And approval requirements should be evaluated

  @self-improvement @monitoring
  Scenario: Monitor Improvement Results
    Given improvements have been executed successfully
    And baseline metrics were captured before execution
    When I monitor the improvement results
    Then new metrics should be compared to baseline
    And improvement impact should be quantified
    And success rates should be calculated
    And performance deltas should be measured

  @self-improvement @performance
  Scenario: Performance Improvement Execution
    Given the system identifies database query performance issues
    And response time optimization is prioritized
    When I execute performance improvements
    Then database queries should be optimized
    And response time metrics should improve by 15-25%
    And memory usage should remain stable
    And improvement should be verified through testing

  @self-improvement @security
  Scenario: Security Improvement Implementation
    Given security analysis identifies 3 vulnerabilities
    And security improvements are prioritized as high
    When I execute security improvements
    Then vulnerability scanning should be performed
    And identified vulnerabilities should be addressed
    And security score should improve by at least 15 points
    And security validation should confirm fixes

  @self-improvement @quality
  Scenario: Code Quality Enhancement
    Given code analysis identifies complexity issues
    And test coverage is below target thresholds
    When I execute quality improvements
    Then code complexity should be reduced
    And test coverage should increase by at least 8%
    And code maintainability should improve
    And quality metrics should meet standards

  @self-improvement @reliability
  Scenario: System Reliability Improvement
    Given reliability analysis identifies failure scenarios
    And error handling gaps are detected
    When I execute reliability improvements
    Then comprehensive error recovery should be added
    And failure scenarios should be addressed
    And system reliability score should increase by 25 points
    And uptime should improve measurably

  @self-improvement @efficiency
  Scenario: Algorithm Efficiency Optimization
    Given computational efficiency analysis is complete
    And algorithm optimization opportunities are identified
    When I execute efficiency improvements
    Then algorithm complexity should be reduced
    And processing speed should improve by 30%
    And CPU utilization should decrease by 20%
    And efficiency gains should be sustainable

  @self-improvement @rollback
  Scenario: Improvement Rollback on Failure
    Given improvements are being executed
    And one improvement fails during implementation
    When the failure is detected
    Then all completed improvements should be rolled back
    And the system should return to baseline state
    And rollback telemetry should be comprehensive
    And failure analysis should be available

  @self-improvement @compensation
  Scenario: Improvement Compensation Logic
    Given a multi-step improvement process is executing
    And step 3 fails during execution
    When compensation is triggered
    Then steps 1 and 2 should be compensated in reverse order
    And all side effects should be undone
    And system state should be restored completely
    And compensation should be verified

  @self-improvement @adaptive
  Scenario: Adaptive Improvement Concurrency
    Given the system is under varying load conditions
    And improvement execution is adaptive
    When system load changes during execution
    Then concurrency should adjust automatically
    And high load should reduce concurrent improvements
    And low load should increase concurrent improvements
    And adaptation should be smooth and efficient

  @self-improvement @telemetry
  Scenario: Comprehensive Improvement Telemetry
    Given improvement execution is instrumented
    And telemetry collection is enabled

    And new improvement opportunities should be identified
    And high-priority improvements should be queued
    And improvement history should be maintained

  @self-improvement @learning
  Scenario: Improvement Pattern Learning
    Given the system has executed 50+ improvements

    And error rates should be reduced
    And user satisfaction metrics should improve
    And improvement ROI should be positive

  @self-improvement @ai-integration
