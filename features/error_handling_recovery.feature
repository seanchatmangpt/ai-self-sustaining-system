Feature: Error Handling and Recovery Processes
  As an AI Self-Sustaining System
  I want comprehensive error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms
  So that I can maintain system resilience and minimize service disruptions

  Background:
    Given error handling middleware is enabled for all Reactor workflows
    And compensation logic is defined for all critical operations
    And automatic recovery mechanisms are configured
    And error telemetry and logging are operational

  @critical @error-handling
  Scenario: Reactor Workflow Compensation on Step Failure
    Given I have a 5-step Reactor workflow with compensation logic
    And each step has defined compensation actions
    And step 3 will fail during execution
    When the workflow executes and fails at step 3
    Then steps 1 and 2 should be compensated in reverse order
    And all side effects from completed steps should be undone
    And the system should return to the pre-workflow state
    And compensation telemetry should record all actions taken
    And failure context should be preserved for analysis

  @critical @error-handling
  Scenario: Database Transaction Rollback on Failure
    Given I have a workflow that performs multiple database operations
    And the workflow uses database transactions
    And the final database operation will fail
    When the workflow executes and encounters the database failure
    Then all database changes should be rolled back automatically
    And database consistency should be maintained
    And transaction failure should be logged with context
    And retry logic should be available for transient failures
    And data integrity should be verified post-rollback

  @error-handling @retry
  Scenario: Exponential Backoff Retry for Transient Failures
    Given I have a network operation that may fail transiently
    And retry logic is configured with exponential backoff
    And max_retries is set to 3 with base delay of 1 second
    When the operation fails with a transient error
    Then the first retry should occur after ~1 second
    And the second retry should occur after ~2 seconds
    And the third retry should occur after ~4 seconds
    And each retry should include random jitter
    And permanent failures should not trigger retries

  @error-handling @circuit-breaker
  Scenario: Circuit Breaker Pattern for External Service Failures
    Given I have integration with an external service
    And circuit breaker is configured with 5 failure threshold
    And circuit breaker is configured with 30 second timeout
    When the external service fails repeatedly
    Then circuit breaker should open after 5 consecutive failures
    And subsequent requests should fail fast without calling the service
    And circuit breaker should attempt recovery after 30 seconds
    And successful requests should close the circuit breaker
    And circuit breaker state should be monitored and logged

  @error-handling @graceful-degradation
  Scenario: Graceful Service Degradation on Component Failure
    Given the system has primary and fallback mechanisms
    And a critical component becomes unavailable
    When the component failure is detected
    Then the system should switch to degraded mode
    And essential functionality should remain available
    And users should be notified of degraded service
    And system should monitor for component recovery
    And full service should be restored when component recovers

  @error-handling @timeout
  Scenario: Timeout Handling for Long-Running Operations
    Given I have a Reactor step with 30 second timeout
    And the step will take 45 seconds to complete
    When the step executes and exceeds timeout
    Then the step should be cancelled after 30 seconds
    And timeout error should be raised with context
    And any partial work should be cleaned up
    And compensation should be triggered for dependent steps
    And timeout events should be logged and tracked

  @error-handling @validation
  Scenario: Input Validation and Error Reporting
    Given I have a workflow that requires specific input format
    And input validation is configured
    When invalid input is provided to the workflow
    Then validation should fail before workflow execution
    And detailed validation errors should be returned
    And no partial execution should occur
    And validation failures should be logged
    And input validation should prevent system corruption

  @error-handling @resource
  Scenario: Resource Exhaustion Handling
    Given the system is under high load
    And resource limits are configured (memory, CPU, connections)
    When resource limits are approached or exceeded
    Then new requests should be throttled or rejected
    And existing work should be prioritized by importance
    And resource exhaustion should be logged and alerted
    And system should attempt to free resources where possible
    And recovery should be automatic when resources become available

  @error-handling @deadlock
  Scenario: Database Deadlock Detection and Resolution
    Given multiple concurrent workflows access shared database resources
    And database deadlock is possible
    When database deadlock occurs
    Then deadlock should be detected within 10 seconds
    And one transaction should be rolled back to break deadlock
    And deadlock victim should be retried automatically
    And deadlock events should be logged with transaction details
    And deadlock patterns should be analyzed for prevention

  @error-handling @corruption
  Scenario: Data Corruption Detection and Recovery
    Given data integrity checks are enabled
    And backup and recovery mechanisms are in place
    When data corruption is detected
    Then corrupted data should be identified and isolated
    And system should attempt recovery from backups
    And data consistency should be verified after recovery
    And corruption events should be logged and investigated
    And preventive measures should be implemented

  @error-handling @cascading
  Scenario: Cascading Failure Prevention
    Given I have interconnected system components
    And failure isolation mechanisms are configured
    When one component fails
    Then failure should be contained within the component
    And dependent components should handle failure gracefully
    And cascading failures should be prevented
    And system should maintain partial functionality
    And failure propagation should be monitored and logged

  @error-handling @monitoring
  Scenario: Error Rate Monitoring and Alerting
    Given error rate monitoring is configured
    And alerting thresholds are defined
    When error rates exceed normal thresholds
    Then alerts should be triggered within 30 seconds
    And error patterns should be analyzed automatically
    And escalation procedures should be initiated
    And error trends should be tracked over time
    And corrective actions should be recommended

  @error-handling @recovery
  Scenario: Automatic System Recovery
    Given system health monitoring is active
    And automatic recovery procedures are defined
    When system health degradation is detected
    Then recovery procedures should be initiated automatically
    And system should attempt self-healing actions
    And recovery progress should be monitored
    And manual intervention should be requested if needed
    And recovery actions should be logged and tracked

  @error-handling @state
  Scenario: Stateful Error Recovery
    Given I have a stateful process that maintains context
    And the process fails partway through execution
    When error recovery is initiated
    Then process state should be restored to last known good state
    And context should be preserved across recovery
    And recovery should continue from the failure point
    And state consistency should be verified
    And recovery should handle state corruption gracefully

  @error-handling @user-experience
  Scenario: User-Friendly Error Communication
    Given users interact with the system through various interfaces
    And error communication standards are defined
    When errors occur that affect user operations
    Then users should receive clear, actionable error messages
    And technical details should be logged separately
    And error resolution steps should be provided when possible
    And user impact should be minimized through graceful handling
    And error feedback should be collected for improvement

  @error-handling @testing
  Scenario: Error Scenario Testing and Validation
    Given comprehensive error scenarios are defined
    And error injection testing is configured
    When error scenario tests are executed
    Then all error handling paths should be validated
    And recovery mechanisms should be verified
    And error logging should be confirmed
    And system resilience should be measured
    And error handling improvements should be identified
