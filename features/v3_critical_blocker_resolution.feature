Feature: V3 Critical Blocker Resolution
  As a V3 Implementation Team
  I want to systematically resolve all critical blockers preventing V3 progression
  So that the foundation is stable for enterprise-scale deployment

  Background:
    Given V3 implementation has identified critical blockers
    And blocker resolution tracking is active
    And all resolution steps are instrumented with telemetry

  @critical @v3 @blocker
  Scenario: Claude AI Integration Rebuilding
    Given Claude AI integration has 100% failure rate
    And Claude CLI is available in the environment
    And API credentials are configured correctly
    When I execute the Claude AI integration rebuild process
    Then Claude CLI should respond successfully to version checks
    And basic Claude coordination queries should work
    And Claude API authentication should be validated
    And all coordination commands should be testable
    And integration failure rate should drop below 5%

  @critical @v3 @blocker
  Scenario: Script Duplication Elimination
    Given the system has 164 total scripts with only 45 unique implementations
    And script duplication causes 3-4x maintenance overhead
    When I execute the script consolidation process
    Then duplicate scripts should be identified and categorized
    And original scripts should be preserved in main locations
    And worktree copies should be replaced with smart wrappers
    And symlink management system should be established
    And maintenance overhead should be reduced by 70%

  @critical @v3 @blocker
  Scenario: Missing Coordination Commands Implementation
    Given only 15 coordination commands are implemented vs documented 40+
    And command coverage gap is 62.5%
    When I implement the missing coordination commands
    Then all documented Claude AI commands should be functional
    And all Scrum at Scale commands should be implemented
    And all agent management commands should be available
    And all deployment commands should be operational
    And command coverage should reach 95%+

  @critical @v3 @blocker
  Scenario: Environment Portability Achievement
    Given hard-coded paths prevent production deployment
    And environment-specific dependencies exist throughout the codebase
    When I implement environment portability solutions
    Then all paths should be dynamically resolved
    And environment detection should work across platforms
    And configuration should be externalized from code
    And deployment should work in any directory
    And zero hard-coded dependencies should remain

  @critical @v3 @blocker
  Scenario: Deployment Reliability Improvement
    Given XAVOS deployment shows 20% success rate
    And complex Ash package dependencies cause failures
    When I implement deployment reliability improvements
    Then deployment process should be simplified and validated
    And dependency validation should occur before deployment
    And incremental deployment should be implemented
    And rollback mechanisms should be available
    And deployment success rate should exceed 80%

  @v3 @validation
  Scenario: Critical Blocker Resolution Validation
    Given all critical blockers have been addressed
    And resolution validation is required before V3 progression
    When I validate complete blocker resolution
    Then Claude AI integration should be 100% functional
    And script count should be reduced to 45 unique implementations
    And all 40+ coordination commands should be working
    And environment portability should be validated
    And deployment reliability should meet enterprise standards

  @v3 @metrics
  Scenario: Blocker Resolution Impact Measurement
    Given blocker resolution is complete
    And impact measurement is required
    When I measure the impact of blocker resolution
    Then maintenance overhead should be reduced by 70%
    And system reliability should improve by 95%
    And deployment velocity should increase by 300%
    And operational efficiency should improve by 80%
    And foundation readiness for V3 should be confirmed

  @v3 @continuity
  Scenario: Performance Baseline Preservation
    Given current system achieves 105.8/100 health score
    And 148 coordination ops/hour with zero conflicts
    When critical blockers are resolved
    Then performance baseline should be maintained or improved
    And health score should remain above 105.0/100
    And coordination operations should meet or exceed current rate
    And zero-conflict guarantee should be preserved
    And performance regression should be prevented

  @v3 @integration
  Scenario: Cross-Component Integration Validation
    Given all critical blockers are resolved individually
    And cross-component integration is required
    When I validate integrated system functionality
    Then all components should work together seamlessly
    And integration points should be stable and reliable
    And end-to-end workflows should function correctly
    And system stability should be maintained under load
    And integration telemetry should show healthy status

  @v3 @readiness
  Scenario: V3 Foundation Readiness Assessment
    Given critical blocker resolution is complete
    And foundation readiness assessment is required
    When I assess V3 foundation readiness
    Then all technical blockers should be resolved
    And all operational blockers should be addressed
    And all integration issues should be fixed
    And foundation should be ready for enterprise scaling
    And V3 implementation can proceed with confidence
