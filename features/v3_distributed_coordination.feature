Feature: V3 Distributed Agent Coordination
  As a V3 Enterprise Platform
  I want distributed agent coordination across multiple nodes supporting 100+ concurrent agents
  So that I can achieve enterprise-scale coordination with fault tolerance and high availability

  Background:
    Given distributed Erlang clustering is configured
    And multi-node coordination infrastructure is active
    And 100+ agent capacity is available
    And distributed state management is operational

  @critical @v3 @distributed
  Scenario: 100+ Agent Distributed Coordination
    Given I have a distributed Erlang cluster with 5 nodes
    And each node can handle 20+ agents effectively
    When I deploy 100 agents across the cluster
    Then agents should be distributed evenly across nodes
    And inter-node coordination should maintain <100ms latency
    And work distribution should be balanced automatically
    And cluster coordination should handle node failures gracefully
    And total coordination capacity should scale linearly

  @critical @v3 @clustering
  Scenario: Automatic Erlang Cluster Formation
    Given I have multiple BEAM nodes available for clustering
    And cluster formation configuration is in place
    When nodes start and attempt to form a cluster
    Then nodes should discover each other automatically
    And cluster should form without manual intervention
    And cluster topology should be established correctly
    And cluster health should be monitored continuously
    And node failures should trigger automatic cluster healing

  @critical @v3 @fault-tolerance
  Scenario: Node Failure Recovery and Coordination Continuity
    Given a distributed cluster with 100 active agents
    And one node fails unexpectedly
    When the cluster detects the node failure
    Then agents on failed node should be redistributed automatically
    And work claims should be transferred to surviving nodes
    And coordination operations should continue without interruption
    And cluster should rebalance load across remaining nodes
    And recovery should complete within 30 seconds

  @v3 @load-balancing
  Scenario: Dynamic Load Balancing Across Cluster Nodes
    Given agents are distributed across cluster nodes
    And node loads vary due to different workloads
    When load imbalance is detected across nodes
    Then load balancing should automatically redistribute agents
    And high-load nodes should shed work to low-load nodes
    And load balancing should minimize coordination disruption
    And optimal resource utilization should be maintained
    And load balancing decisions should be logged for analysis

  @v3 @consensus
  Scenario: Distributed Consensus for Critical Coordination Decisions
    Given multiple nodes need to make coordination decisions
    And consensus is required for critical operations
    When distributed consensus protocol is executed
    Then all nodes should reach agreement on decisions
    And consensus should be achieved within 5 seconds
    And consensus protocol should handle network partitions
    And consensus decisions should be persistent and recoverable
    And consensus performance should scale with cluster size

  @v3 @state-synchronization
  Scenario: Distributed State Synchronization
    Given coordination state exists across multiple nodes
    And state synchronization is required for consistency
    When state changes occur on any node
    Then state changes should propagate to all nodes
    And eventual consistency should be achieved quickly
    And conflict resolution should handle concurrent updates
    And state synchronization should be efficient and scalable
    And state integrity should be maintained across the cluster

  @v3 @partition-tolerance
  Scenario: Network Partition Handling and Recovery
    Given a distributed cluster experiences network partition
    And cluster splits into isolated node groups
    When network partition occurs
    Then each partition should continue operating independently
    And coordination should remain available in each partition
    And conflict resolution should prepare for partition recovery
    And when partition heals, state should be reconciled automatically
    And no coordination data should be lost during partition

  @v3 @cross-node-communication
  Scenario: Efficient Cross-Node Agent Communication
    Given agents are distributed across multiple nodes
    And cross-node communication is required for coordination
    When agents communicate across node boundaries
    Then cross-node messages should be delivered reliably
    And message delivery should be optimized for latency
    And message ordering should be preserved where required
    And cross-node communication should be monitored for performance
    And communication patterns should be optimized automatically

  @v3 @cluster-monitoring
  Scenario: Comprehensive Cluster Health Monitoring
    Given a distributed cluster is operational
    And cluster monitoring is configured
    When I monitor cluster health and performance
    Then node health should be tracked continuously
    And inter-node connectivity should be monitored
    And cluster performance metrics should be available
    And cluster topology changes should be detected
    And cluster health dashboards should provide real-time visibility

  @v3 @elastic-scaling
  Scenario: Elastic Cluster Scaling Based on Demand
    Given cluster load varies based on agent demand
    And elastic scaling is configured
    When agent demand increases beyond cluster capacity
    Then new nodes should be added to cluster automatically
    And agents should be distributed to new nodes
    And when demand decreases, nodes should be removed safely
    And scaling operations should not disrupt coordination
    And scaling decisions should be based on performance metrics

  @v3 @multi-datacenter
  Scenario: Multi-Datacenter Cluster Coordination
    Given cluster nodes are distributed across datacenters
    And multi-datacenter coordination is configured
    When cross-datacenter coordination is required
    Then datacenter-aware routing should be implemented
    And cross-datacenter latency should be minimized
    And datacenter failures should be handled gracefully
    And data consistency should be maintained across datacenters
    And multi-datacenter performance should meet SLA requirements

  @v3 @cluster-security
  Scenario: Secure Distributed Cluster Communication
    Given cluster security is configured for enterprise deployment
    And secure communication is required between nodes
    When cluster nodes communicate
    Then all inter-node communication should be encrypted
    And node authentication should be verified
    And access control should be enforced across cluster
    And security audit logs should be maintained
    And security compliance should meet enterprise standards

  @v3 @global-coordination
  Scenario: Global Coordination Operations Across Cluster
    Given complex workflows require global coordination
    And global coordination mechanisms are available
    When global coordination operations are executed
    Then global locks should be managed efficiently
    And global state should be consistent across cluster
    And global operations should complete within SLA
    And global coordination should handle node failures
    And global coordination performance should scale with cluster size

  @v3 @cluster-upgrade
  Scenario: Rolling Cluster Upgrades Without Downtime
    Given cluster requires software upgrades
    And zero-downtime upgrade is required
    When rolling upgrade is performed
    Then nodes should be upgraded one at a time
    And coordination should continue during upgrades
    And upgraded and non-upgraded nodes should interoperate
    And upgrade process should be rollback-capable
    And upgrade should complete without data loss or downtime
