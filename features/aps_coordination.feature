Feature: APS (Agile Protocol Specification) Coordination
  As an AI Agent Swarm
  I want to coordinate through structured APS YAML specifications
  So that I can maintain perfect inter-agent communication and workflow orchestration

  Background:
    Given the APS coordination system is active
    And the "agent_coordination" directory exists
    And APS YAML specifications follow the defined schema
    And agent roles include PM_Agent, Architect_Agent, Developer_Agent, QA_Agent, DevOps_Agent

  @critical @aps
  Scenario: Create New APS Process Specification
    Given I need to define a new "Feature_Implementation_Login" process
    And the process requires PM_Agent, Architect_Agent, and Developer_Agent roles
    When I create a new APS specification
    Then the APS YAML should contain process metadata
    And all required agent roles should be defined with responsibilities
    And activities should be mapped to specific agent roles
    And Gherkin scenarios should be included for behavior specification
    And data structures should define message formats

  @critical @aps
  Scenario: Agent Role Assignment from APS Specification
    Given I have an APS specification with defined roles
    And multiple agents are available for assignment
    When agents initialize and read the APS specification
    Then each role should be assigned to exactly one agent
    And agent assignments should be atomic and conflict-free
    And assignment metadata should be recorded with timestamps
    And role dependencies should be respected

  @aps @handoff
  Scenario: APS-Compliant Agent Handoff
    Given PM_Agent has completed requirements analysis
    And the APS specification defines handoff to Architect_Agent
    And the handoff includes requirements artifacts
    When PM_Agent triggers APS handoff
    Then handoff message should follow APS YAML message format
    And all required artifacts should be referenced correctly
    And Architect_Agent should receive complete context
    And handoff should be recorded in APS process state

  @aps @validation
  Scenario: APS YAML Schema Validation
    Given I have an APS YAML file with potential schema violations
    And the file may have missing required fields
    When I validate the APS specification
    Then validation should check process name and description
    And validation should verify all roles have descriptions
    And validation should confirm activities are properly assigned
    And validation should validate Gherkin scenario structure
    And detailed error messages should be provided for violations

  @aps @state-management
  Scenario: APS Process State Tracking
    Given I have an active APS process "Feature_Implementation_Login"
    And the process has moved through multiple states
    When I query the process state
    Then current state should be accurately reflected
    And state history should be maintained
    And agent progress should be tracked per activity
    And completion percentages should be calculated
    And blockers and dependencies should be visible

  @aps @messaging
  Scenario: Inter-Agent APS Message Exchange
    Given Developer_Agent needs to send a message to QA_Agent
    And the message concerns completed feature implementation
    When Developer_Agent creates an APS message
    Then the message should follow APS message format
    And message should include sender, recipient, and timestamp
    And relevant artifacts should be properly referenced
    And message should be deliverable to QA_Agent
    And message history should be maintained

  @aps @parallel
  Scenario: Parallel APS Process Execution
    Given I have 3 independent APS processes running simultaneously
    And each process has different agent assignments
    When all processes execute concurrently
    Then process isolation should be maintained
    And agent assignments should not conflict across processes
    And each process should maintain independent state
    And cross-process coordination should be available when needed

  @aps @escalation
  Scenario: APS Process Escalation and Error Handling
    Given an APS process is blocked for over 2 hours
    And the blocking issue cannot be resolved automatically
    When escalation criteria are met
    Then the process should be marked as escalated
    And escalation notifications should be sent to appropriate agents
    And escalation context should include complete process history
    And alternative resolution paths should be suggested

  @aps @metrics
  Scenario: APS Process Performance Metrics
    Given multiple APS processes have completed successfully
    And process execution metrics are being collected
    When I analyze APS process performance
    Then average process completion time should be calculated
    And agent utilization rates should be measured
    And handoff efficiency should be quantified
    And bottlenecks should be identified and reported
    And performance trends should be tracked over time

  @aps @template
  Scenario: APS Process Template Management
    Given I have common workflow patterns that repeat frequently
    And I want to standardize these patterns
    When I create APS process templates
    Then templates should capture reusable workflow structures
    And templates should allow parameterization
    And new processes should be creatable from templates
    And template versioning should be supported
    And template compliance should be enforceable

  @aps @integration
  Scenario: APS Integration with Reactor Workflows
    Given I have an APS process that uses Reactor for execution
    And the APS specification includes technical implementation details
    When the process executes using Reactor workflows
    Then APS coordination should integrate seamlessly with Reactor
    And Reactor steps should be mapped to APS activities
    And APS state should be updated based on Reactor execution
    And both APS and Reactor telemetry should be captured

  @aps @documentation
  Scenario: APS Process Documentation Generation
    Given I have completed APS processes with full execution history
    And I need comprehensive process documentation
    When I generate APS process documentation
    Then documentation should include process overview and objectives
    And agent role responsibilities should be clearly defined
    And execution timeline should be visualized
    And lessons learned should be captured
    And process improvements should be recommended

  @aps @compliance
  Scenario: APS Specification Compliance Checking
    Given agents are executing work according to APS specifications
    And compliance monitoring is enabled
    When I check APS compliance
    Then agent actions should align with assigned activities
    And handoffs should follow specified protocols
    And message formats should comply with APS schema
    And deviation from specifications should be flagged
    And compliance reports should be generated regularly

  @aps @versioning
  Scenario: APS Specification Version Management
    Given I have an APS specification that needs updates
    And the specification is currently in use by active processes
    When I create a new version of the APS specification
    Then version changes should be tracked
    And backward compatibility should be maintained
    And active processes should continue with their version
    And new processes should use the latest version
    And migration paths should be available when needed

  @aps @audit
  Scenario: APS Process Audit Trail
    Given APS processes have been executing over time
    And comprehensive audit trails are required
    When I generate APS audit reports
    Then all process activities should be traceable
    And agent actions should be timestamped and attributed
    And decision points should be documented
    And artifact creation and modification should be tracked
    And audit trails should be immutable and verifiable
