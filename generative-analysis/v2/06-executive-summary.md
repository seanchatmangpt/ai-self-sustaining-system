## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Information Loss Prevention

**Mathematical Validation:**
```python
# Continuous information conservation monitoring
def validate_information_conservation():
    before_entropy = calculate_system_entropy(baseline_state)
    after_entropy = calculate_system_entropy(current_state)
    conservation_ratio = after_entropy / before_entropy
    
    assert 0.99 <= conservation_ratio <= 1.01, \
        f"Information loss detected: {conservation_ratio}"
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
```bash
# Automated rollback on information loss detection
if [[ $(validate_information_conservation) != "PASS" ]]; then
    echo "Information loss detected - initiating rollback"
    ./rollback_to_baseline.sh
    exit 1
fi
```

### Performance Preservation

**Performance Monitoring:**
```yaml
# Real-time performance alerts
alerts:
  - name: ResponseTimeHigh
    condition: P95(response_time) > 100ms
    action: auto_scale_processor
