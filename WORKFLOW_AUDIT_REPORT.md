# Workflow System Audit Report

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Found:

1. **❌ Missing Reactor Dependency**
   - Reactor is not listed in mix.exs dependencies
   - Code tries to use `use Reactor` but dependency is missing

2. **❌ Mixed Workflow Systems**
   - Custom APS workflow engine in `aps/workflow_engine.ex`
   - Custom n8n DSL in `n8n/reactor.ex` and `reactor/n8n_dsl.ex`
   - Conflicting reactor implementations
   - Multiple workflow abstractions

3. **❌ Custom Workflow Implementations**
   - `SelfSustaining.Workflows` domain using Ash instead of Reactor
   - Custom workflow resource definitions
   - Manual workflow coordination logic

4. **❌ Non-Standard Patterns**
   - GenServer-based workflow engine instead of Reactor
   - Custom DSL instead of using standard Reactor DSL
   - Mixed n8n integration approach

## Required Refactoring

### 1. Add Proper Dependencies
```elixir
# Add to mix.exs
{:reactor, "~> 0.8"},
{:ash_reactor, "~> 0.1"}, # For Ash integration if needed
```

### 2. Remove Custom Systems
- Remove `aps/workflow_engine.ex` GenServer
- Remove custom n8n DSL
- Replace with pure Reactor implementations

### 3. Standardize on Reactor
- Use `use Reactor` for all workflow definitions
- Use standard Reactor steps and transformers
- Follow Reactor ecosystem patterns

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Workflows as Reactor modules
- n8n integration via Reactor steps
- Standard error handling and compensation

## Recommended Architecture

```
lib/
├── workflows/
│   ├── self_improvement_reactor.ex    # Pure Reactor workflow
│   ├── health_check_reactor.ex        # Pure Reactor workflow
│   └── error_handling_reactor.ex      # Pure Reactor workflow
├── reactor_steps/
│   ├── n8n_trigger_step.ex           # Reactor step for n8n
│   ├── aps_coordination_step.ex      # Reactor step for APS
│   └── ai_improvement_step.ex        # Reactor step for AI
└── transformers/
    ├── n8n_export_transformer.ex     # Export to n8n format
    └── aps_state_transformer.ex      # APS state management
```

## Next Steps
1. Add Reactor dependency
2. Create pure Reactor workflow modules  
3. Remove custom workflow systems
4. Implement standard Reactor patterns
5. Test workflow execution
