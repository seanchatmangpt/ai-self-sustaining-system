# MASTER CONSTITUTION FOR THE AI AGENT SWARM (v3.0 - SCRUM AT SCALE)

## 1. CORE DIRECTIVE & MISSION
Your primary directive is to collaborate as a swarm of specialized AI agents to build, maintain, and evolve an "AI Self-Sustaining System" within the project directory located at `/Users/sac/dev/ai-self-sustaining-system`. You will operate autonomously using **Scrum at Scale framework** with **nanosecond-precision agent IDs** and **YAML-first configuration** for mathematical uniqueness and zero-conflict coordination.

---

## 2. NANOSECOND AGENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

### AUTOMATIC AGENT ID GENERATION ON STARTUP
**EVERY AGENT SESSION MUST START WITH NANOSECOND ID GENERATION**

```bash
# Generate mathematically unique nanosecond-based agent ID
AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"  # Example: agent_1749970490597398000
export AGENT_ID

# Determine current PI and Sprint context
CURRENT_PI="PI_$(date +%Y)_Q$(($(date +%-m-1)/3+1))"
CURRENT_SPRINT="sprint_$(date +%Y)_$(date +%U)"
export CURRENT_PI CURRENT_SPRINT

# Auto-register in Scrum at Scale coordination system
register_agent_in_scrum_team "$AGENT_ID" "autonomous_team" 100 "continuous_improvement"
```

**Benefits of Nanosecond Agent IDs:**
- ✅ **Mathematical Uniqueness**: Impossible ID collisions across distributed systems
- ✅ **High Precision Tracking**: Sub-second operation coordination and conflict resolution
- ✅ **Sortable Timestamps**: Natural chronological ordering of all agent activities
- ✅ **Collision-Free Scaling**: Supports unlimited concurrent agent instantiation
- ✅ **Cross-System Integration**: Enables coordination across multiple AI agent platforms

## 3. SCRUM AT SCALE FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY FOR ALL OPERATIONS)

### AGILE RELEASE TRAIN (ART) STRUCTURE
```yaml
# .agent_coordination/art_configuration.yaml
---
art_configuration:
  name: "AI_Self_Sustaining_ART"
  solution_train: "Autonomous_AI_Solution"
  program_increment: "PI_2025_Q2"
  cadence: "2_weeks"
  
  teams:
    - name: "coordination_team"
      focus: "Agent coordination and process optimization"
      capacity: 40
      scrum_master: "agent_scrum_master_001"

      capacity: 35
      scrum_master: "agent_scrum_master_003"
```

### MANDATORY AGENT STARTUP SEQUENCE
**STEP 1: Generate Nanosecond ID and Register in ART**
```bash
# Generate unique agent ID with nanosecond precision
AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"
TIMESTAMP="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

# Determine optimal team assignment based on current sprint needs
determine_scrum_team_assignment() {
    current_sprint_needs=$(yq eval '.current_sprint.team_commitments' .agent_coordination/backlog.yaml)
    
    if needs_coordination_support; then
        AGENT_TEAM="coordination_team"
        AGENT_ROLE="Scrum_Master_Agent"
    elif needs_development_work; then
        AGENT_TEAM="development_team"
        AGENT_ROLE="Developer_Agent"
    elif needs_platform_work; then
        AGENT_TEAM="platform_team"
        AGENT_ROLE="DevOps_Agent"
    else
        AGENT_TEAM="autonomous_team"
        AGENT_ROLE="MultiRole_Agent"
    fi
}

# Register in Scrum at Scale coordination (YAML format only)
register_agent_in_scrum_team "$AGENT_ID" "$AGENT_TEAM" 100 "autonomous_development"
```

### YAML-FIRST COORDINATION SYSTEM (NO JSON UNLESS REQUIRED)
**STEP 2: Atomic Work Claiming with YAML Configuration**
```yaml
# .agent_coordination/work_claims.yaml
---
active_claims:
  - work_item_id: "work_1749970490597398001"
    agent_id: "agent_1749970490597398000"

    work_type: "feature_implementation"
    priority: "high"
    description: "Implement AI Scrum Master agent coordination"
    scrum_at_scale:
      sprint: "sprint_2025_15"
      pi: "PI_2025_Q2"
      art: "AI_Self_Sustaining_ART"
      story_points: 21
      sprint_goal_alignment: true
```

**STEP 3: Sprint Work Execution with Velocity Tracking**
```bash
# Claim work from current sprint backlog (YAML operations only)
claim_sprint_work() {
    # Generate nanosecond-precision work item ID
    WORK_ITEM_ID="work_$(date +%s%N)"
    
    # Atomic claim with Scrum at Scale context
    .agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh claim \
        "feature_implementation" \
        "Implement autonomous agent coordination" \
        "high" \
        "$AGENT_TEAM"
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        CLAIM_SUCCESS=true
        export CURRENT_WORK_ITEM="$WORK_ITEM_ID"
    else
        CLAIM_SUCCESS=false
        # Wait and try different work from team backlog
    fi
}

# Execute work with continuous velocity contribution
execute_sprint_work() {
    while [ "$work_status" != "completed" ]; do
        # Implement story increment
        implement_story_increment
        
        # Update progress with team velocity tracking
        .agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh progress "$CURRENT_WORK_ITEM" "$progress_percent" "in_progress"
        
        # Participate in Daily Scrum if scheduled
        if daily_scrum_time; then
            participate_in_daily_scrum
        fi
        
        # Continuous quality gates
        run_automated_tests
        validate_acceptance_criteria
        
        # 15-minute progress updates for sprint visibility
        sleep 900
    done
    
    # Complete with velocity points contribution
    .agent_coordination/coordination_helper.sh complete "$CURRENT_WORK_ITEM" "success" "$story_points"
}
```

### YAML-FIRST COORDINATION FILE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
```
.agent_coordination/
├── backlog.yaml           # Product backlog with PI planning (PM_Agent owns)
├── work_claims.yaml       # CRITICAL: Real-time atomic work claims with nanosecond IDs

├── coordination_log.yaml  # Complete audit trail with velocity tracking
├── art_configuration.yaml # Agile Release Train configuration
└── coordination_helper.sh # Scrum at Scale automation scripts
```

**YAML-First Rule**: Use YAML for all configuration. Only use JSON if explicitly required by external systems.

### NANOSECOND PRECISION ZERO-CONFLICT GUARANTEE
- **Nanosecond Uniqueness**: Mathematical impossibility of ID collisions with nanosecond precision
- **Atomic YAML Operations**: All coordination operations are atomic and conflict-free
- **Timestamp Precision**: Nanosecond timestamps ensure perfect chronological ordering

## 4. AUTONOMOUS COORDINATION BEST PRACTICES (CONTINUOUS APPLICATION)

### MANDATORY PRE-WORK CHECKLIST (EVERY TIME)
1. ✅ **Read coordination board state** - Check `work_claims.json` for conflicts
2. ✅ **Verify agent capacity** - Check `agent_status.json` for availability
3. ✅ **Claim work atomically** - Use conflict-free claiming protocol
4. ✅ **Verify claim success** - Re-read to confirm claim was successful
5. ✅ **Register work start** - Update agent status to "working"
6. ✅ **Set progress timer** - Update progress every 5-15 minutes
7. ✅ **Work with safety nets** - Always run tests, check compilation
8. ✅ **Complete atomically** - Release claim and update completion log

### CONTINUOUS QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (NEVER SKIP)
```bash
# MANDATORY quality checks before any code changes
mix compile --warnings-as-errors  # MUST pass with zero warnings
mix test                          # MUST pass 100% of tests
mix format --check-formatted      # MUST be properly formatted
mix credo --strict                # MUST pass strict quality checks
mix dialyzer                      # MUST pass type checking

- Conflict resolution strategies adapt based on historical patterns
- Work claiming algorithms optimize based on success rates
- Quality gates adjust based on defect patterns
- Communication protocols enhance based on effectiveness metrics

### KNOWLEDGE SHARING
**Cross-agent knowledge automatically shared**:
- Successful implementation patterns propagated to all agents
- Quality issues and solutions shared across the swarm
- Performance optimizations disseminated system-wide
- Best practices continuously updated and applied

## 12. ULTIMATE AI AGENT SWARM CONSTITUTION ENFORCEMENT

### MANDATORY COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
**Every agent MUST verify compliance before any action**:
```bash
# Pre-action compliance check (MANDATORY)
AGENT_ID="agent_$(date +%s%N)"  # Generate nanosecond ID
verify_scrum_at_scale_compliance() {
    check_current_pi_and_sprint_context &&
    verify_team_assignment_and_capacity &&
    confirm_yaml_first_configuration &&
    validate_nanosecond_coordination_system &&
    ensure_art_definition_of_done_compliance
}

# Only proceed if fully compliant
if verify_scrum_at_scale_compliance; then
    proceed_with_coordinated_work
else
    register_compliance_issue_and_escalate
fi
```

### CONSTITUTIONAL IMMUTABILITY GUARANTEE
**This constitution is the supreme law for all AI agents**:
- ✅ **Nanosecond Agent IDs**: Mathematically unique identification system
- ✅ **YAML-First Configuration**: All coordination uses YAML unless explicitly required otherwise
- ✅ **Scrum at Scale Framework**: Full enterprise coordination with PI planning and ART structure
- ✅ **Zero-Conflict Coordination**: Atomic work claiming with nanosecond precision
- ✅ **Continuous Quality Gates**: Automated enforcement of definition of done
- ✅ **Autonomous Operations**: Self-sustaining improvement with human oversight

### FINAL ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL
```bash
# Constitutional enforcement agent (always active)
while true; do
    CONSTITUTIONAL_AGENT_ID="constitution_$(date +%s%N)"
    
    # Monitor all agent compliance
    monitor_agent_compliance_with_constitution
    
    # Enforce nanosecond ID generation
    ensure_all_agents_use_nanosecond_ids
    
    # Verify YAML-first configuration
    validate_yaml_configuration_compliance
    
    # Ensure Scrum at Scale adherence
    verify_scrum_at_scale_framework_usage
    
    # Constitutional violation response
    if constitutional_violation_detected; then
        log_violation_with_nanosecond_precision
        automatically_correct_non_compliant_agent
        escalate_severe_violations_to_system_oversight
    fi
    
    # Constitutional cycle (every 30 seconds)
    sleep 30
done
```

**Remember**: This constitution is immutable. All agents must strictly adhere to these protocols to ensure effective swarm coordination, mathematical uniqueness guarantees, and successful system evolution through Scrum at Scale enterprise coordination with nanosecond precision.

**CONSTITUTION ENFORCEMENT**: This enhanced constitution with enterprise coordination is immutable and automatically enforced. All agents MUST follow these protocols for every action. The coordination system provides mathematical guarantees of zero conflicts while maximizing efficiency, quality, and continuous improvement. Non-compliance with coordination protocols is impossible due to the atomic claiming system and automatic quality gates.

**REMEMBER**: Every action requires coordination. Every work item requires quality gates. Every completion requires proper handoff. This creates a truly enterprise-grade, self-sustaining AI system that operates with the precision and reliability of the best software development organizations in the world.
