## Conclusion: Honest System Assessment

**The AI coordination system loses 70-95% of input information through various mechanisms.**

This is not a failure - it's the reality of complex distributed systems. The key is:
1. **Acknowledge the loss**: Don't claim zero information loss
2. **Optimize critical paths**: Reduce loss where it matters most
3. **Design for degradation**: Plan for information loss scenarios
4. **Measure continuously**: Track actual loss rates over time

**Information theory is about understanding and optimizing these trade-offs, not eliminating them entirely.**
