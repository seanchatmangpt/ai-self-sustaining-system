        The Reactor framework provides a comprehensive solution for building complex data processing pipelines in Elixir. 
        It uses a step-based architecture that enables modular, testable, and maintainable workflows. Each step in a 
        Reactor can perform data transformation, validation, or integration tasks. The framework supports both 
        synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns, allowing for optimal performance in various scenarios.
        
        Error handling is built into the core of Reactor through compensation mechanisms. When a step fails, 
        the framework can automatically execute compensation logic to roll back changes or perform cleanup operations. 
        This ensures data consistency and system reliability even in the face of failures.
        
        Telemetry integration provides comprehensive observability throughout the pipeline execution. Each step 
        is instrumented with timing metrics, success/failure tracking, and custom metadata collection. This 
        enables detailed performance analysis and debugging capabilities for complex workflow scenarios.

        Customer onboarding represents a critical touchpoint in the user journey that directly impacts retention 
        and lifetime value. The current process involves multiple manual steps that create friction and delay 
        time-to-value for new customers. Research indicates that customers who complete onboarding within the 
        first 24 hours are 3x more likely to become long-term active users.
        
        Our analysis reveals three primary pain points: account verification takes an average of 6 hours due to 
        manual review processes, feature discovery is poor because of inadequate guided tutorials, and initial 
        configuration requires technical knowledge that many users lack. These issues combine to create a 
        suboptimal first impression that reduces conversion rates by approximately 25%.

        Machine learning models exhibit various forms of bias that can significantly impact their performance 
        and fairness. Algorithmic bias typically emerges from three primary sources: biased training data that 
        doesn't represent the target population adequately, biased feature selection that amplifies existing 
        societal prejudices, and biased evaluation metrics that favor certain demographic groups.
        
        Training data bias occurs when historical data contains systematic discrimination or underrepresentation. 
        For example, hiring algorithms trained on historical HR data may perpetuate gender or racial bias present 
        in past hiring decisions. Feature selection bias happens when relevant demographic information is used 
        directly or indirectly through proxy variables, leading to discriminatory outcomes.
