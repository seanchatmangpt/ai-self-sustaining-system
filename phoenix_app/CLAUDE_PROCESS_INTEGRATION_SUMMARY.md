## Architecture Achievements

### 1. **Unix-Style Utility Integration** üîß
```elixir
# Claude Code executed as command-line utility
claude_cmd = "claude -p #{escaped_prompt} #{output_flag}"
# Input via stdin, output via stdout
full_command = "echo '#{escaped_input}' | #{command}"
```

### 2. **Process-Based Reactor Execution** üèóÔ∏è
```elixir
defmodule ClaudeProcessReactor do
  use Reactor
  
  # Process management with supervisor pattern
  step :start_supervisor do
    # Spawn supervisor for child process management
  end
  
  # Parallel execution with trace propagation
  step :process_claude_tasks do
    # Execute multiple Claude tasks concurrently
  end
end
```

### 3. **Trace ID Propagation** üîç
```elixir
# Master trace ID creation
master_trace_id = "claude_process_#{System.system_time(:nanosecond)}"

# Child trace propagation
child_trace_id = "#{master_trace_id}_task_#{task.id}_#{System.system_time(:nanosecond)}"

# Context preservation across processes
context = %{
  trace_id: child_trace_id,
  master_trace_id: master_trace_id
}
```

### 4. **Performance Metrics Collection** üìà
```elixir
metrics = %{
  performance: %{
    success_rate: 66.67,
    processing_time_ms: 8936,
    speedup_factor: 2.67
  },
  trace_propagation: %{
