defmodule SelfSustaining.N8N.ClientTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Test suite for the N8N workflow automation client integration.

  Validates the SelfSustaining.N8N.Client module functionality including
  connection testing, health checking, workflow management, and execution monitoring.
  Tests are designed to be resilient to N8N service availability.

  ## Test Categories

  ### Connection Management
  - **test_connection/0**: Validates connection establishment with N8N service
  - **health_check/0**: Verifies health status reporting functionality

  ### Workflow Operations
  - **get_workflow/1**: Tests workflow retrieval by ID
  - **list_executions/2**: Validates execution history listing

  ## Resilient Testing

  Tests are designed to handle both scenarios:
  - **N8N Available**: When N8N service is running and accessible
  - **N8N Unavailable**: When N8N service is not running (expected in test environment)

  All tests pass regardless of N8N availability, allowing for:
  - Continuous integration without N8N dependency
  - Local development flexibility
  - Integration testing when N8N is available

  ## Usage Patterns

  Tests cover realistic usage scenarios:
  - Basic connectivity and health monitoring
  - Workflow retrieval for automation
  - Execution monitoring and history tracking
  - Error handling for service unavailability

  ## Integration Notes

  This test suite validates client interface contracts while being tolerant
  of external service dependencies. Real integration testing should be
  performed separately with actual N8N service availability.
