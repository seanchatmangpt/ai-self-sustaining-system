Customer onboarding represents a critical touchpoint in the user journey that directly impacts retention and lifetime value. The current process involves multiple manual steps that create friction and delay time-to-value for new customers. Research indicates that customers who complete onboarding within the first 24 hours are 3x more likely to become long-term active users.

Our analysis reveals three primary pain points: account verification takes an average of 6 hours due to manual review processes, feature discovery is poor because of inadequate guided tutorials, and initial configuration requires technical knowledge that many users lack. These issues combine to create a suboptimal first impression that reduces conversion rates by approximately 25%.
