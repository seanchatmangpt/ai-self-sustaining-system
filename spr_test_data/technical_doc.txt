The Reactor framework provides a comprehensive solution for building complex data processing pipelines in Elixir. It uses a step-based architecture that enables modular, testable, and maintainable workflows. Each step in a Reactor can perform data transformation, validation, or integration tasks. The framework supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns, allowing for optimal performance in various scenarios.

Error handling is built into the core of Reactor through compensation mechanisms. When a step fails, the framework can automatically execute compensation logic to roll back changes or perform cleanup operations. This ensures data consistency and system reliability even in the face of failures.

Telemetry integration provides comprehensive observability throughout the pipeline execution. Each step is instrumented with timing metrics, success/failure tracking, and custom metadata collection. This enables detailed performance analysis and debugging capabilities for complex workflow scenarios.
